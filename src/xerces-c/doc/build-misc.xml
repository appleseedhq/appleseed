    <anchor name="ICUPerl"/>
    <s2 title="Building &XercesCName; with ICU">
        <p>&XercesCName; may be built in stand-alone mode using
        native encoding support and also using ICU where you get support for over 180
        different encodings and/or locale specific message support. ICU stands for
        International Components for Unicode and is an open source distribution from
        IBM. You can get ICU libraries from
        <jump href="http://icu-project.org/">ICU project site</jump>.</p>

        <note><em>Important:</em> Please remember that <em>ICU and
        &XercesCName; must be built with the same compiler</em>,
        preferably with the same version. You cannot for example,
        build ICU with a threaded version of the xlC compiler and
        build &XercesCName; with a non-threaded one.</note>
        <p/>
        <s3 title="Building on Windows">
        <p>There are two options to build &XercesCName; with ICU on Windows. One is to use the
        MSDEV GUI environment, and the other is to invoke the compiler from the
        command line.</p>

        <p>Using, the GUI environment, requires one to edit the project files.
        Here, we will describe only the second option. It involves using the
        perl script '<code>packageBinaries.pl</code>'.</p>

        <p><em>Prerequisites:</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Perl 5.004 or higher</li>
        <li>Cygwin tools or MKS Toolkit</li>
        <li>zip.exe</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Extract &XercesCName; source files from the .zip archive using WinZip, say
        in the root directory (an arbitrary drive x:). It should create a directory like
        '<code>x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir;</code>'.</p>

        <p>Extract the ICU files, using WinZip, in root directory of the disk
        where you have installed &XercesCName;, sources. After extraction, there
        should be a new directory '<code>x:\icu</code>' which contains all the ICU
        source files.</p>

        <p>Start a command prompt to get a new shell window. Make sure you have
        perl, cygwin tools (<code>uname</code>, <code>rm</code>,
        <code>cp</code>, ...), and <code>zip.exe</code> somewhere in the
        path. Next setup the environment for MSVC using
        '<code>VCVARS32.BAT</code>' or a similar file. Then at the prompt
        enter:</p>

<source>set XERCESCROOT=x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir;
set ICUROOT=x:\icu
cd x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\scripts
</source>

        <p>To build with ICU, either specify using ICU transcoding service,</p>

<source>
perl packageBinaries.pl -s x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir; -o x:\temp\&XercesCInstallDir;-win32 -t icu
</source>

        <p> or specify using ICU message loader service</p>

<source>
perl packageBinaries.pl -s x:\&XercesCSrcInstallDir; -o x:\temp\&XercesCInstallDir;-win32 -m icu
</source>

        <p>(Match the source directory to your system; the target directory can be
        anything you want.)</p>

        <p>If everything is setup right and works right, then you should see a
        binary drop created in the target directory specified above. This script
        will build both ICU and &XercesCName;, and copy the files (relevant to the binary
        drop) to the target directory.</p>

        <p>If the parser is built with icu message loader (as mentioned above), or message
         catalog loader, you need an environment variable, XERCESC_NLS_HOME to point to
         the directory, $XERCESCROOT/msg, where the message files reside.
        </p>

        <p>For a description of options available, you can enter:</p>
<source>perl packageBinaries.pl</source>
        </s3>
        <s3 title="Building on UNIX">
        <p>Extract &XercesCName; source files into, say, the home directory ($HOME).
        It should create a directory like '<code>$HOME/&XercesCSrcInstallDir;</code>'.</p>

        <p>Extract the ICU files into the same directory
        where you have installed &XercesCName; sources. After extraction, there
        should be a new directory '<code>$HOME/icu</code>' which contains all the ICU
        source files.</p>

        <p>Build the ICU according to the<jump href="http://icu-project.org/">
        ICU Build instruction in ICU Readme</jump>.   Then have its dll, <code>libicuuc*</code>
        and <code>libicudt*</code> available from your library search path.</p>

        <p>Then build the &XercesCName; with ICU.  This is similar to building a standalone
        &XercesCName; library as instructed in <jump href="build-winunix.html#UNIX">
        "Building &XercesCName; on UNIX platforms"</jump>; except that you have to specify
        the transcoder option <code>'-t icu'</code> and/or the message loader option
        <code>'-m icu'</code>.  For example:</p>
<source>runConfigure -plinux -cgcc -xg++ -minmem -nsocket -ticu -rpthread</source>

        <p>Or instead of building the ICU and &XercesCName; manually in two steps,
        you can use the bundled perl script '<code>packageBinaries.pl</code>' which
        will build both of them in one step.  For example:</p>
<source>export XERCESCROOT=$HOME/&XercesCSrcInstallDir;
export ICUROOT=$HOME/icu
cd $HOME/&XercesCSrcInstallDir;/scripts
</source>

        <p>To build with ICU, either specify using ICU transcoding service,</p>

<source>
perl packageBinaries.pl -s $HOME/&XercesCSrcInstallDir; -o $HOME/temp/&XercesCInstallDir;-aix -t icu
</source>

        <p> or specify using ICU message loader service</p>

<source>
perl packageBinaries.pl -s $HOME/&XercesCSrcInstallDir; -o $HOME/temp/&XercesCInstallDir;-aix -m icu
</source>

        <p>If the parser is built with icu message loader (as mentioned above), or message
         catalog loader, you need an environment variable, XERCESC_NLS_HOME to point to
         the directory, $XERCESCROOT/msg, where the message files reside.
        </p>

    <anchor name="RPMLinux"/>
    <s2 title="Building &XercesCName; using RPM on Linux">
        <p>&XercesCName; may be built from the distributed source archive directly on Linux
        using RPM.  For example: </p>
<source>
rpm -ta &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar.gz (rpm 4.0 and older)
or
rpmbuild -ta &XercesCSrcInstallDir;.tar.gz (rpm 4.1 and later; ships with RedHat 8)
</source>
        <p>The &XercesCName; RPM specification can be found in
           <br/><code>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;/xerces-c.spec</code>.</p>
        <p>Please refer to the <jump href="http://www.rpm.org/RPM-HOWTO">RPM-HOWTO</jump>,
           for more RPM related information.</p>
    </s2>

    <anchor name="WinCOM"/>
    <s2 title="Building &XercesCName; COM Wrapper on Windows">
        <p>To build the COM module for use with XML on Windows platforms, you
        must first set up your machine appropriately with necessary tools and
        software modules and then try to compile it. The end result is an additional
        library that you can use along with the standard &XercesCName; for writing
        VB templates or for use with IE 5.0 using JavaScript.</p>

        <s3 title="Setting up your machine for COM">
        <p>To build the COM project you will need to install the MS PlatformSDK.
        Some of the header files we use don't come with Visual C++ 6.0. You may
        download it from Microsoft's Website at <jump href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/setuplauncher.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/setuplauncher.htm</jump>
        or directly FTP it from <jump href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/PlatformSDK/April2000/Msi/WinNT/x86/InstMsi.exe">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/PlatformSDK/April2000/Msi/WinNT/x86/InstMsi.exe</jump>.</p>

        <p>The installation is huge, but you don't need most of it. So you
        may do a <em>custom install</em> by just selecting "Build Environment" and
        choosing the required components. First select the top level Platform SDK.
        Then click the down arrow and make all of the components unavailable. Next open the
        "Build Environment" branch and select only the following items:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Win32 API</li>
        <li>Component Services</li>
        <li>Web Services - Internet Explorer</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Important:</em> When the installation is complete you need to update VC6's
        include path to include <code>..\platformsdk\include\atl30</code>. You do this by
        choosing "Tools -> Options -> Directories". This path
        should be placed <ref>second</ref> after the normal PlatformSDK include.
        You change the order of the paths by clicking the up and down arrows.</p>

        <note>The order in which the directories appear on your path is important. Your
        first include path should be <code>..\platformsdk\include</code>. The second one
        should be <code>..\platformsdk\include\atl30</code>.</note>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Building COM module for &XercesCName;">
        <p>Once you have set up your machine, build &XercesCName; COM module
        by choosing the project named 'xml4com' inside the workspace. Then select your
        build mode to be <em>xml4com - Win32 Release MinDependency</em>. Finally build the
        project. This will produce a DLL named <code>xerces-com.dll</code> which needs
        to be present in your path (on local machine) before you can use it.</p>
        </s3>

        <s3 title="Testing the COM module">
        <p>There are some sample test programs in the <code>test/COMTest</code>
        directory which show examples of navigating and searching an XML tree
        using DOM. You need to browse the HTML files in this directory using
        IE 5.0. Make sure that your build has worked properly, specially the
        registration of the ActiveX controls that happens in the final step.</p>
        <p>You may also want to check out the NIST DOM test suite at
        <jump href="http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/BRADY/DOM/">http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/BRADY/DOM/</jump>.
        You will have to modify the documents in the NIST suite to load the
        Xerces COM object instead of the MSIE COM object.</p>
        </s3>
    </s2>


    <anchor name="UserDoc"/>
    <s2 title="Building User Documentation">
        <p>The user documentation (this very page that you are reading
        on the browser right now), was generated using an XML
        application called StyleBook. This application makes use of
        Xerces-J and Xalan to create the HTML file from the XML source
        files. The XML source files for the documentation are part of
        the &XercesCName; module. These files reside in the
        <code>doc</code> directory.</p>

        <p><em>Pre-requisites for building the user documentation are:</em></p>

        <ul>
          <li>JDK 1.2.2 (or later).</li>
          <li>Xerces-J 1.0.1 (provided by &XercesCToolsInstallDir;)</li>
          <li>Xalan-J 0.19.2 (provided by &XercesCToolsInstallDir;)</li>
          <li>Stylebook 1.0-b2 (provided by &XercesCToolsInstallDir;)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Before proceeding, copy the contents of the &XercesCToolsInstallDir;
           distribution into your <code>$XERCESCROOT</code>. Then invoke
           a terminal or a command window and setup PATH to include the
           JDK 1.2.2 bin directory. Next, cd to the <code>$XERCESCROOT</code>
           source root directory, and enter:</p>

<source>
createDocs.bat (Windows)
./createDocs.sh (UNIX)
</source>

        <p>This should generate the .html files in the 'doc/html' directory.</p>

        <p>To regenerate the API documentation, you need to have at least
           <jump href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</jump>
           installed on your system.</p>

        <p>If you want the API documentation to
           contain dependency graphs, you also need to have <jump
           href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">GraphViz</jump> installed on
           your system.</p>

        <p>If you do not have GraphViz, or do not want to use it, you
           have to edit file <code>$XERCESCROOT/doc/Doxyfile</code> and change <code>HAVE_DOT =
           YES</code> into <code>HAVE_DOT = NO</code>.</p>

        <p>To actually regenerate the API documentation, go to directory
           <code>$XERCESCROOT/doc/</code> and start Doxygen. The result can be
           found in directory <code>$XERCESCROOT/doc/html/apiDocs</code>.</p>
    </s2>


    <anchor name="PortInfo"/>
    <s2 title="I wish to port &XercesCProjectName; to my favourite platform. Do you have any suggestions?">
      <p>All platform dependent code in &XercesCProjectName; has been
      isolated to a couple of files, which should ease the porting
      effort.  Please refer to <jump href="program-others.html#PortingGuidelines">Porting
      Guidelines</jump> for further details.</p>
    </s2>


    <anchor name="XMLChInfo"/>
    <s2 title="What should I define XMLCh to be?">
        <p>XMLCh should be defined to be a type suitable for holding a
           utf-16 encoded (16 bit) value, usually an <code>unsigned short</code>. </p>

        <p>All XML data is handled within &XercesCName; as strings of
           XMLCh characters.  Regardless of the size of the
           type chosen, the data stored in variables of type XMLCh
           will always be utf-16 encoded values. </p>



        <p>Unlike XMLCh, the  encoding
               of wchar_t is platform dependent.  Sometimes it is utf-16
               (AIX, Windows), sometimes ucs-4 (Solaris,
               Linux), sometimes it is not based on Unicode at all
               (HP/UX, AS/400, system 390).  </p>

        <p>Some earlier releases of &XercesCName; defined XMLCh to be the
           same type as wchar_t on most platforms, with the goal of making
           it possible to pass XMLCh strings to library or system functions
           that were expecting wchar_t parameters.  This approach has
           been abandoned because of</p>

           <ul>
              <li>
                 Portability problems with any code that assumes that
                 the types of XMLCh and wchar_t are compatible
              </li>

              <li>Excessive memory usage, especially in the DOM, on
                  platforms with 32 bit wchar_t.
              </li>

              <li>utf-16 encoded XMLCh is not always compatible with
                  ucs-4 encoded wchar_t on Solaris and Linux.  The
                  problem occurs with Unicode characters with values
                  greater than 64k; in ucs-4 the value is stored as
                  a single 32 bit quantity.  With utf-16, the value
                  will be stored as a "surrogate pair" of two 16 bit
                  values.  Even with XMLCh equated to wchar_t, xerces will
                  still create the utf-16 encoded surrogate pairs, which
                  are illegal in ucs-4 encoded wchar_t strings.
               </li>
           </ul>

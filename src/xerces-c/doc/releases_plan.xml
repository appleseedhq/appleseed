<s1 title="Future Releases Plan">

<s2 title="&XercesCName; Future Releases Plan">
<p>This document highlights the release plan for &XercesCName;.</p>

<s3 title="Current Status"><p>&XercesCName; 2.8.0 - released on August 31, 2007.</p></s3>

<s3 title="Next Target Release">
	<p>The &XercesCName; team is currently working on plans for future releases.
	At present, we believe there will be a 3.0 release with new functionality
	targeted roughly at the end of 2007. As a change in the major version allows us
	to break source compatibility, we are trying to take our time in order to
	break now what needs to be broken. There is some chance that changes breaking
	source compatibility will not be needed, and that "3.0" features will be
	released in the 2.x line.</p>
	<p>Further releases in the 2.x line are anticipated concurrent with 3.0 development
	in order to fix issues or bugs in 2.x. Once 3.0 is released, we may also issue
	further 2.x releases as needed by the community.</p>
	<p>&XercesCName; 2.y.z - as needed to address bugs or other issues.</p>
	<p>&XercesCName; 3.0 - Targetted roughly for the end of 2007.</p>
</s3>

<s3 title="&XercesCName; 3.0 (tentative) Features list">

	<p>The following table lists the potential TODO items for &XercesCName; 3.0.
	It does not include fixing bugs that are opened in Jira; unless such Jira bug
	involves a major development effort and requires an architectural redesign,
	or is an enhancement suggestion.</p>

	<p>This list tracks current ideas and developer sign-up for 3.0 features. Some items
	on this list have no volunteer. Items that have no volunteer will receive no
	development attention and therefore will not become part of 3.0. If you would
	like to volunteer for these or other items please email the &XercesCName; mailing
	list</p>

     *
     *   fmt_uchar:  The printf() format to use when rendering data which is

     *               character (no quotes).  If the character is one of the
     *               standard C escapes then print the escaped version.  If
     *               the character is unprintable then print a 3-digit octal
     *               escape.  If `ascii' is zero then then 1-byte integers are
     *               printed as numeric values.  The default is zero.
     *
     *   str_locale: Determines how strings are printed. If zero then strings
     *               are printed like in C except. If set to ESCAPE_HTML then

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - CMake: Improved CPack packaging, added parallel commands, improved
      configuration options (better similarity to configure), added more
      tests, better support for use in external cmake projects. 
      (ADB - 2010/10/07)
    - The default configuration setting for official releases is 
      --enable-production. For unofficial releases, the default configuration 
      setting has been --disable-production. (AKC  - 2010/05/28)
    Library
    -------
    - Added support for thread safety on Windows using the Windows threads 
      library. Use the HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE option in CMake on a Windows 
      platform to enable this functionality. This is supported on Windows 
      Vista and newer Windows operating systems. (MAM - 2010/09/10)
    - H5Tset_order and H5Tget_order now support all datatypes.  A new byte 
      order, H5T_ORDER_MIXED, has been added specifically for a compound 
      datatype and its derived type.  (SLU - 2010/8/23) 
    - Improved performance of metadata I/O by changing the default algorithm 
      to perform I/O from all processes (instead of just process 0) when using 
      parallel I/O drivers. (QAK - 2010/07/19)
    - Improved performance of I/O on datasets with the same shape, but 
      different rank. (QAK - 2010/07/19)
    - Improved performance of the chunk cache by avoiding unnecessary b-tree 
      lookups of chunks already in cache. (NAF - 2010/06/15) 
      
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5diff: Added a new flag: --exclude-path.  The specified path to an 
      object will be excluded when comparing two files or two groups. If a 
      group is specified to be excluded, all member objects of that group 
      will be excluded.  (JKM - 2010/09/16).
    - h5ls: Added a new flag: --no-dangling-links.  See --help output for 
      details. (JKM - 2010/06/15)
    - h5ls: Added a new flag --follow-symlinks.  See --help output for 
      details. (JKM - 2010/05/25)
      
    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    F90 API
    -------
     - None

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - Sun C and C++ 5.10 and Sun Fortran 95 8.4.
    - Mac OS X 10.6.4 with gcc 4.2.1 and gfortran 4.6


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.5
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - The default number of MPI processes for testing purposes has been 
      changed from 3 to 6.  (AKC - 2010/11/11)
    - Some tests in tools/h5repack may fail in AIX systems when -q32 mode is 
      used. The error is caused by not requesting enough memory in default.
      Added "env LDR_CNTRL=MAXDATA=0x20000000@DSA" into the $RUNSERIAL and
      $RUNPARALLE in the AIX config file so that executables are tested with
      more memory.  (AKC - 2010/11/11)
    - Removed recognition of the parallel compilers of LAM(hcc) and
      ChMPIon(cmpicc) since we have no access to these two MPI implementations
      and cannot verify their correctness. (AKC - 2010/07/14 - Bug 1921)
    - PHDF5 was changed to use "mpiexec" instead of mpirun as the default 
      MPI applications startup command as defined in the MPI-2 definition, 
      section 4.1. (AKC - 2010/06/11 - Bug 1921)
      
    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a bug that caused big endian machines to generate corrupt files
      when using the scale-offset filter with floating point data or fill
      values.  Note that such datasets will no longer be readable by any
      by any machine after this patch.  (NAF - 2010/02/02 - Bug 2131)
    - Retrieving a link's name by index in the case where the link is external
      and the file that the link refers to doesn't exist will now fail 
      gracefully rather than cause a segmentation fault. (MAM - 2010/11/17)
    - Modified metadata accumulator to better track accumulated dirty metadata 
      in an effort to reduce unnecessary I/O in certain situations and to 
      fix some other corner cases which were prone to error. (MAM - 2010/10/15)
    - Added a new set of unit tests that are run during 'make check' to verify 
      the behavior of the metadata accumulator. (MAM - 2010/10/15)
    - Modified library to always cache symbol table information.  Libraries
      from version 1.6.3 and earler have a bug which causes them to require 
      this information for some operations. (NAF - 2010/09/21 - Bug 1864)
    - Fixed a bug where the library could generate an assertion/core dump when
      a file that had been created with H5Pset_libver_bounds(fapl,
      H5F_LIBVER_LATEST, H5F_LIBVER_LATEST) but didn't have a superblock
      extension was later reopened.  (QAK - 2010/09/16 - Bug 1968)
    - Fixed a bug that could occur when getting information for a new-style
      group that was previously opened through a file handle that was later
      closed. (NAF - 2010/09/15)
    - Added define check in H5public.h if stdint.h is supported by the C++
      compiler. This define is only available on Windows with VS2010 and using
      CMake to build the library. (ADB - 2010/09/13 - Bug 1938)
    - When a mandatory filter failed to write data chunks, the dataset
      couldn't close (bug 1260).  The fix releases all resources and closes
      the dataset but returns a failure. (SLU - 2010/09/08) 
    - H5Eset_current_stack now also closes the error stack set as the 
      default. This is to avoid a potential problem. 
      (SLU - 2010/09/07 - Bug 1799)
    - Corrected situation where 1-D chunked dataset could get created by an
      application without calling H5Pset_chunk().  H5Pset_chunk is now
      required for creating all chunked datasets.  (QAK - 2010/09/02)
    - Fixed many memory issues that valgrind exposed.  (QAK - 2010/08/24)
    - Fixed the bug in the filter's public CAN_APPLY function.  The return
      value should be htri_t not herr_t. (SLU - 2010/08/05 - Bug 1239)
    - Fixed the STDIO VFD to use fseeko64 instead of fseek64 for 64-bit I/O 
      support. (AKC - 2010/7/30)
    - Fixed a bug in the direct I/O driver that could render files with certain
      kinds of unaligned data unreadable or corrupt them. (NAF - 2010/07/28)
    - valgrind reported an error of copying data to itself when a new attribute 
      is written.  Fixed by taking out the memcpy step in the attribute code. 
      (SLU - 2010/07/28 - Bug 1956)
    - Corrected various issues in the MPI datatype creation code which could
      cause resource leaks or incorrect behavior (and may improve the
      performance as well).  (QAK - 2010/07/19)
    - Fixed a bug that could cause file corruption when using non-default sizes
      of addresses and/or lengths.  This bug could also cause uncorrupted files
      with this property to be unreadable.  This bug was introduced in 1.8.5.
      (NAF - 2010/07/16 - Bug 1951)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - Fixed h5diff to compare member objects and groups recursively when 
      two files or groups are compared. (JKM - 2010/9/16 - Bug 1975)
    - Fixed h5repack to be able to convert a dataset to COMPACT layout.
      (JKM - 2010/09/15 - Bug 1896)
    - Changed h5ls to not interpret special characters in object or attribute
      names for output. (JKM - 2010/06/28 - Bug 1784)
    - Revised the order of arguments for h5cc, h5fc, h5c++, h5pcc and h5pfc. 
      CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LIBS have been duplicated with an H5BLD_ 
      prefix to put the flags and paths from the hdf5 build in the correct 
      places and allow the script user to add entries in CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, 
      LDFLAGS, and LIBS that will take precedence over those from the hdf5 
      build. The user can make these entries persistent by editing 
      CFLAGSBASE, CPPFLAGSBASE, LDFLAGSBASE, and LIBSBASE near the top of 
      the script or temporary by setting HDF5_CFLAGS, HDF5_CPPFLAGS, 
      HDF5_LDFLAGS, or HDF5_LIBS in the environment. The new order of 
      arguments in these scripts is $CLINKER $H5BLD_CPPFLAGS $CPPFLAGS 
      $H5BLD_CFLAGS $CFLAGS $LDFLAGS $clibpath $link_objs $LIBS $link_args 
      $shared_link. (LRK - 2010/10/25 - Bug 1973)

Known Problems
==============
* examples/run-all-ex.sh does not work on Cygwin. (NAF - 2011/02/11)

* Parallel test, t_shapesame in testpar, is rather unstable as it continues to
  have occasional errors in AIX and quite often in NCSA Abe. It is being built
  but it is not run automatically in the "make check" command. One would have to
  run it by hand to see if it works in a particular machine. AKC - 2011/01/28

* Although OpenVMS Alpha is supported, there are several problems with the C
  test suite - getname.c, lheap.c, lheap.c, mtime.c, and stab.c.  The test
  suite for h5diff also fails.  These failures are from the tests, not the
  library.  We have fixed these failures.  But it's too late to put the fixes
  into this release.  If you install the 1.8.6 library, it should still work
  despite of these test failures.  If you want the working copy without any
  test failure, you can request it from us.  SLU - 2011/01/26 

* If parallel gmake (e.g., gmake -j 4) is used, the "gmake clean" command
  sometimes fails in the perform directory due to the attempt to remove the
  executable of h5perf or h5perf_serial by two "parallel" commands. This error
  has no consequence on the functionality of the HDF5 library or install. It
  is fixed in the next release. AKC - 2011/01/25

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or filesystems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/

* The h5diff tool can display garbage values when variable-length strings in 
  a compound type dataset are compared. This also occurs with variable-length 
  string arrays in a compound type dataset. See bug #1989. This will be fixed 
  in the next release. JKM - 2010/11/05

* The AIX --enable-shared setting does not quite work. It can produce a shared 
  library, but there cannot be more than one shared library that is 
  interlinked. This means that the high level APIs will not work which is not 
  very useful. We hope to have a solution in the next release. 
  (AKC - 2010/10/15)
  
* H5Eset_auto can cause a seg fault for a library API call if the application
  compiles with -DH5_USE_16_API (see bug 1707).  It will be fixed in the 
  next release. SLU - 2010/10/5
  
* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on 
  Cygwin when converting an unsigned long long to a long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to 
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.  Please see bug #1813. 
  SLU - 2010/5/5
  
* All the VFL drivers aren't backwardly compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the 
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  A new parameter was added to the 
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions, and a new callback function 
  get_type_map was added. The public function H5FDrealloc was taken out in 
  1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver for 1.6 
  and try to plug in a 1.8 library. This will be fixed in 1.10. SLU - 2010/2/2

* MinGW has a missing libstdc++.dll.a library file and will not successfully link
  C++ applications/tests. Do not use the enable-cxx configure option. Read all of
  the INSTALL_MINGW.txt file for all restrictions. ADB - 2009/11/11
  
* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would 
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file does not 
  exist. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the amode has 
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (See bug 1468 for details.) AKC - 2009/8/11

* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and 
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of their sub-tests. These 
  sub-tests are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but 
  the yod command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod 
  always returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell 
  expects a non-zero for this particular test. Therefore, it concludes the 
  test has failed when it receives 0 from yod.  To skip all the "failing" 
  tests for now, change them as shown below.

  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the 
  message  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery."  This interferes 
  with test suites that do not expect to see this message.  See the "Red Storm" 
  section in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem. 
  AKC - 2008/05/28
  
* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use the -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level 
  of optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests.
  
* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6 on a system using four processors, if more than 
  two processes contribute no I/O and the application asks to do collective 
  I/O, we have found that a simple collective write will sometimes hang. This 
  can be verified with the t_mpi test under testpar.
  
* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 or later library cannot be 
  read with the v1.6.2 or earlier library when the Fletcher32 EDC filter 
  is enabled. There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum 
  in the library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3. However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 
  1.6.4 can still read datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of 
  v1.6.2 or earlier. SLU - 2005/6/30
  
* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error 
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'. To 
  work around this, set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to 
  minimize the messages and run the tests again. The tests may fail with 
  messages like "The socket name is already in use", but HDF5 does not use 
  sockets. This failure is due to problems with the poe command trying to 
  set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, check to see whether 
  there are any old /tmp/s.pedb.* files around. These are sockets used by 
  the poe command and left behind if the command failed at some point. To 
  resolve this, ask your system administrator to remove the 
  old/tmp/s.pedb.* files, and then ask IBM to provide a means to run poe 
  without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link 
  libraries if the static version of that library is present. If only the 
  shared version of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on 
  Solaris, AIX, and Mac, for example, only have shared versions), the flag 
  should still result in a successful compilation, but note that the 
  installed executables will not be fully static. Thus, the only guarantee 
  on these systems is that the executable is statically linked with just 
  the HDF5 library.
  
* On an SGI Altix SMP ia64 system, the Intel compiler version 10.1 (which 
  is the default on that system) does not work properly and results in 
  failures during the make check (in a static build) and the make 
  installcheck (in a shared build). This appears to be a compiler 
  optimization problem. Reducing the optimization by setting CFLAGS to 
  -O1 or below resolves the issue. Using a newer version of the compiler 
  (11.0) avoids the issue. MAM - 2010/06/01
  
* On solaris systems, when running the examples with the scripts installed in
  .../share/hdf5_examples, two of the c tests, h5_extlink and h5_elink_unix2win 
  may fail or generate HDF5 errors because the script commands in c/run-c-ex.sh 
  fail to create test directories red, blue, and u2w.  Moving the '!' in lines 
  67, 70, 73 of run-c-ex.sh will fix the problem.  For example the script command 
  "if ! test -d red; then" will work on solaris if changed to 
  "if test ! -d red; then".

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - CMake Early Access: This release adds support for building HDF5 using
      the CMake system. Initial work has targeted Windows, but other platforms
      can be used. See the CMake.TXT file for more information. Version
      2.8.1 of CMake is required.
    - Configure now adds appropriate defines for supporting large (64-bit)
      files on all systems, where supported, by default, instead of only Linux.
      This large file support is controllable with the --enable-largefile 
      configure option. The Linux-specific --enable-linux-lfs option has been 
      deprecated in favor of this new option. Please note that specifying
      --disable-large does NOT attempt to "turn off" largefile support if it
      is natively supported by the compiler, but rather just disables 
      configure from actively trying to add any additional compiler flags.
      (MAM - 2010/05/05 - Bug # 1772/1434)
    - Fixed an signal handling mask error in H5detect that might result in
      SIGBUS or SIGSEGV failures in some platforms such as Linux on Sparc.
      (AKC - 2010/4/28 - Bug # 1764)
    - Fixed various "strict aliasing" problems, allowing higher levels
      of compiler optimization (in particular, allowing '-O3' to work
      with recent versions of GCC).  (QAK - 2010/04/26)
    - Upgraded versions of autotools used to generate configuration suite.
      We now use Automake 1.11.1, Autoconf 2.65, and Libtool 2.2.6b. 
      (MAM - 2010/04/15)
    - Added the xlc-* and mpcc_r-* BASENAME patterns to be recognized as IBM
      compilers so that the IBM compiler options can be added properly.  This
      allows non-system-default compiler command names (e.g. xlc-m.n.k.l) be
      recognized. (AKC - 2009/11/26)

    Library
    -------
    - Performance is substantially improved when extending a dataset with early 
      allocation. (NAF - 2010/03/24 - Bug # 1637)
    - Added support for filtering densely stored groups.  Many of the API
      functions related to filters have been extended to support dense groups
      as well as datasets.  Pipeline messages can now be stored in a group's
      object header. (NAF/QAK - 2009/11/3)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5dump: Added the new packed bits feature which prints packed bits stored
      in an integer dataset. (AKC/ADB - 2010/5/7) 
    - h5diff: Fixed incorrect behavior (hang) in parallel mode when specifying 
      invalid options (ex: -v and -q). (JKM - 2010/02/17)
    - h5diff: Added new flag --no-dangling-links (see --help for details).
      (JKM - 2010/02/10) 
    - h5diff: Added new flag --follow-symlinks (see --help for details).
      (JKM - 2010/01/25)
    - h5diff: Added a fix to correct the display of garbage values when 
      displaying big-endian data on a little-endian machine. (JKM - 2009/11/20)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    F90 API
    -------
    - None

    C++ API
    -------
    - New member functions
        + Overloaded CommonFG::getObjnameByIdx to take char* for name.
        + Overloaded CommonFG::getObjTypeByIdx to return type name as a char*.
          (BMR - 2010/05/10)
        + Added DataSet::getInMemDataSize() to simplify getting the dataset's
          data size in memory.  (BMR - 2009/07/26)


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - AIX 6.1 has been added. (AKC - 2010/1/4)


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.4
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Fixed various "strict aliasing" problems, allowing higher levels
      of compiler optimization (in particular, allowing '-O3' to work
      with recent versions of GCC).  (QAK - 2010/04/26)

    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a file corruption bug that could happen when shrinking a compressed
      dataset. (NAF - 2010/05/20)
    - Fixed some memory leaks in VL datatype conversion when strings are
      used as fill values. (MAM - 2010/05/12 - Bug # 1826)
    - Fixed an H5Rcreate failure when passing in a -1 for the dataspace 
      identifier. (ADB - 2010/4/28)
    - Fixed a bug when copying objects with NULL references with the
      H5O_COPY_EXPAND_REFERENCE_FLAG flag set. (NAF - 2010/04/08 - Bug # 1815)
    - Added a mechanism to the H5I interface to save returned object identifier 
      structures for immediate re-use if needed. This addresses a potential 
      performance issue by delaying the case when the next identifier to be
      registered has grown so large that it wraps around and needs to be
      checked to see whether it is available for distribution.
      (MAM - 2010/03/15 - Bug # 1730)
    - Files can now be concurrently opened more than once using the core file
      driver, as long as the backing store is used. (NAF - 2010/03/09)
    - Added support for H5O_COPY_EXPAND_EXT_LINK_FLAG to H5Ocopy.  External
      links will now be expanded if this flag is set.
      (NAF - 2010/03/05 - Bug # 1733)
    - Fixed a bug where the library, when traversing an external link, would
      reopen the source file if nothing else worked. (NAF - 2010/03/05)
    - Fixed a bug where fractal heap identifiers for attributes and shared 
      object header messages could be incorrectly encoded in the file for 
      files created on big-endian platforms.  
      Please see http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/known_problems if you 
      suspect you have a file with this problem.  
      (QAK - 2010/02/23 - Bug # 1755)
    - Fixed an intermittent bug in the b-tree code which could be triggered
      by expanding and shrinking chunked datasets in certain ways.
      (NAF - 2010/02/16)
    - H5Tdetect_class said a VL string is a string type.  But when it's in
      a compound type, it said it's a VL type.  THis has been fixed to be 
      consistent; it now always returns a string type. 
      (SLU - 2009/12/10 - Bug # 1584)
    - Allow "child" files from external links to be correctly located when
      relative to a "parent" file that is opened through a symbolic link.
      (QAK - 2009/12/01)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Parallel mode in AIX will fail some of the testcheck_version.sh tests
      where it treats "exit(134) the same as if process 0 had received an abort
      signal.  Fixed.  (AKC - 2009/11/3)

    Tools
    -----
    - Fixed h5ls to return exit code 1 (error) when a non-existent file is
      specified. (JKM - 2010/04/27 - Bug # 1793)
    - Fixed h5copy failure when copying a dangling link that is specified 
      directly. (JKM - 2010/04/22 - Bug # 1817)
    - Fixed an h5repack failure that lost attributes from a dataset of 
      reference type. (JKM - 2010/3/25 - Bug # 1726)
    - Fixed h5repack error that set NULL for object reference values for
      datasets, groups, or named datatypes. (JKM - 2010/03/19 - Bug # 1814)

    F90 API
    ------
    - None 

    C++ API
    ------
    - The constructor PropList::PropList(id) was fixed to act properly
      according to the nature of 'id'.  When 'id' is a property class 
      identifier, a new property list will be created.  When 'id' is a 
      property list identifier, a copy of the property list will be made. 
      (BMR - 2010/5/9)
    - The parameters 'size' and 'bufsize' in CommonFG::getLinkval and
      CommonFG::getComment, respectively, now have default values for the
      user's convenience.  (BMR - 2009/10/23)
    - NULL pointer accessing was fixed.  (BMR - 2009/10/05 - Bug # 1061)
    - Read/write methods of DataSet and Attribute classes were fixed
      to handle string correctly.  (BMR - 2009/07/26)

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Fixed a bug in H5DSattach_scale, H5DSis_attached, and H5DSdetach_scale
      caused by using the H5Tget_native_type function to determine the native
      type for reading the REFERENCE_LIST attribute. This bug was exposed
      on Mac PPC.  (EIP - 2010/05/22 - Bug # 1851) 
    - Fixed a bug in the H5DSdetach_scale function when 0 bytes were   
      allocated after the last reference to a dimension scale was removed         
      from the list of references in a VL element of the DIMENSION_LIST 
      attribute.  Modified the function to comply with the specification: 
      the DIMENSION_LIST attribute is now deleted when no dimension scales 
      are left attached.  (EIP - 2010/05/14 - Bug # 1822)

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - None

           (1) Fortran compiled with g95.
           (2) With PGI and Absoft compilers.
           (3) With PGI compiler for Fortran.
           (4) Using Visual Studio 2008. (Cygwin shared libraries are not 
               supported.)
           (5) Shared C and C++ are disabled when Fortran is configured in.
    Compiler versions for each platform are listed in the preceding
    "Platforms Tested" table.


Known Problems
==============
* The library's test dt_arith.c exposed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works correctly.  A macro is defined for Cygwin 
  to skip this test until we can solve the problem.  (Please see bug #1813.)
  SLU - 2010/5/5 

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is a new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug it into a 1.8 library.  This affects a very small
  number of users.  (See bug report #1279.)  SLU - 2010/2/2

* MinGW has a missing libstdc++.dll.a library file and will not successfully 
  link C++ applications/tests. Do not use the enable-cxx configure option. 
  Read all of the INSTALL_MINGW.txt file for all restrictions. 
  ADB - 2009/11/11
  
* Some tests in tools/h5repack may fail in AIX systems when -q32 mode is used.
  The error is due to insufficient memory requested. Request a large amount
  of runtime memory by setting the following environment variable for more
  memory.
     LDR_CNTRL=MAXDATA=0x20000000@DSA
  AKC - 2009/10/31

* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file is not
  existing. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the amode has
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (See bug 1468 for details.) AKC - 2009/8/11
 
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* For gcc v4.3 and v4.4, with production mode, if -O3 is used, H5Tinit.c
  would fail to compile. Actually bad H5Tinit.c is produced.  If -O (same
  as -O1) is used, H5Tinit.c compiled okay but test/dt_arith would fail.
  When -O0 (no optimizatio) is used, H5Tinit.c compilete okay and all
  tests passed. Therefore, -O0 is imposed for v4.3 and v4.4 of gcc.
  AKC - 2009/04/20

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5

  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use,"  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* On FREE-BSD systems when shared libraries are disabled, make install fails
  in install-examples with the error '"Makefile", line 635: Need an operator'.
  When this error occurs removing or commenting out the line "export
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(LL_PATH)" (line 635 in examples/Makefile) will allow make
  install to finish installing examples.  The problem will be fixed in the
  next release. LRK - 2010/05/26

* On cobalt, an SGI Altix SMP ia64 system, Intel compiler version 10.1 (which
  is the default on that system) does not work properly and results in
  failures during make check (in a static build) and make installcheck (during
  a shared build). This appears to be a compiler optimization problem.
  Reducing optimization by setting CFLAGS to -O1 or below resolves the issue.
  Alternatively, using a newer version of the compiler (11.0) also works as
  intended. MAM - 2010/06/01

- New Features
- Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.3
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Configuration suite now uses Automake 1.11 and Autoconf 2.64.
      MAM 2009/08/31.
    - Changed default Gnu fortran compiler from g95 to gfortran since
      gfortran is more likely installed with gcc now. -AKC 2009/07/19- 

    Library
    -------
    - The embedded library information is displayed by H5check_version() if a
      version mismatch is detected.  Also changed H5check_version() to
      suppress the warning message totally if $HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK is 2
      or higher. (Old behavior treated 3 or higher the same as 1, that is
      print a warning and allows the program to continue. (AKC - 2009/9/28)
    - If a user does not care for the extra library information insert
      in the executables, he may turn it off by --disable-embedded-libinfo
      during configure. (AKC - 2009/9/15)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5diff: h5diff treats two INFINITY values different. Fixed by checking
      (value==expect) before call ABS(...) at h5diff_array.c. This will make 
      that (INF==INF) is true (INF is treated as an number instead of NaN) 
      (PC -- 2009/07/28)
    - h5diff: add option "--use-system-epsilon" to print difference if 
      (|a-b| > EPSILON).
      Change default to use strict equality (PC -- 2009/09/12)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    F90 API
    -------
     - Added H5Oopen_by_addr_f MSB - 9/14/09

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - PathScale compilers are recognized and can build the HDF5 library
      properly. AKC - 2009/7/28 -


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.3
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Removed the following config files, as we no longer support them:
        config/dec-osf*, config/hpux11.00, config/irix5.x, 
        config/powerpc-ibm-aix4.x config/rs6000-ibm-aix5.x config/unicos*
      MAM - 2009/10/08
    - Modified configure and make process to properly preserve user's CFLAGS
      (and company) environment variables. Build will now properly use
      automake's AM_CFLAGS for any compiler flags set by the configure
      process. Configure will no longer modify CFLAGS directly, nor will 
      setting CFLAGS during make completely replace what configure has set up.
      MAM - 2009/10/08
    - Support for TFLOPS, config/intel-osf1, is removed since the TFLOPS
      machine has long retired. AKC - 2009/10/06.
    - Added $(EXEEXT) extension to H5detect when it's executed in the
      src/Makefile to generate H5Tinit.c so it works correctly on platforms 
      that require the full extension when running executables.
      MAM - 2009/10/01 - BZ #1613
    - Configure will now set FC and CXX to "no" when fortran and c++
      are not being compiled, respectively, so configure will not run
      some of the compiler tests for these languages when they are not 
      being used. MAM - 2009/10/01
    - The --enable-static-exec flag will now properly place the -static flag
      on the link line of all installed executables. This will force the 
      executable to link with static libraries over shared libraries, provided
      the static libraries are available. MAM - 2009/08/31 - BZ #1583
    - The PathScale compiler (v3.2) was mistaken as gcc v4.2.0 but it fails to
      recognize some gcc options. Fixed. (see bug 1301). AKC - 2009/7/28 -

    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a bug where writing and deleting many global heap objects (i.e.
      variable length data) would render the file unreadable.  Previously
      created files exhibiting this problem should now be readable.
      NAF - 2009/10/27 - 1483
    - Fixed error in library's internal caching mechanisms which could cause
      an assertion failure (and attendent core dump) when encountering an
      unusually formatted file.  (QAK - 2009/10/13)
    - Fixed incorrect return value for H5Pget_preserve. AKC - 2009/10/08 - 1628
    - Fixed an assertion failure that occurred when H5Ocopy was called on a
      dataset using a vlen inside a compound. NAF - 2009/10/02 - 1597
    - Fixed incorrect return value for H5Pget_filter_by_id1/2 in H5Ppublic.h.
      NAF - 2009/09/25 - 1620
    - Fixed a bug where properties weren't being compared with the registered
      compare callback. NAF - 2009/09/25 - 1555
    - Corrected problem where library would re-write the superblock in a file
      opened for R/W access, even when no changes were made to the file.
      (QAK - 2009/08/20, Bz#1473)
    - Fixed a bug where H5Pget_filter_by_id would succeed when called for a
      filter that wasn't present. NAF - 2009/06/25 - 1250
    - Fixed an issue with committed compound datatypes containing a vlen. Also
      fixed memory leaks involving committed datatypes. NAF - 2009/06/10 - 1593

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - h5dump/h5ls display buffer resize fixed in tools library.
      ADB - 2009/7/21 - 1520
    - perf_serial test added to Windows projects and check batch file. 
      ADB - 2009/06/11 -1504


    F90 API
    ------
    - Fixed bug in h5lget_info_by_idx_f by adding missing arguments, 
      consequently changing the API. New API is:

      SUBROUTINE h5lget_info_by_idx_f(loc_id, group_name, index_field, order, n, &
        link_type, f_corder_valid, corder, cset, address, val_size, hdferr, lapl_id)

        MSB - 2009/9/17 - 1652

    - Corrected the values for the H5L_flags FORTRAN constants: 
        H5L_LINK_ERROR_F, H5L_LINK_HARD_F, H5L_LINK_SOFT_F, H5L_LINK_EXTERNAL_F
        MSB - 2009-09-17 - 1653

    - Added FORTRAN equivalent of C constant H5T_ORDER_NONE: H5T_ORDER_NONE_F
        MSB - 2009-9-24 - 1471

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Fixed a bug where the H5TB API would forget the order of fields when added
      out of offset order. NAF - 2009/10/27 - 1582
    - H5DSis_attached failed to account for different platform types. Added a
      get native type call. ADB - 2009/9/29 - 1562

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Lite: the h5ltread_dataset_string_f and h5ltget_attribute_string_f functions 
           had memory problems with the g95 fortran compiler. (PVN � 5/13/2009) 1522

Known Problems
==============
* Parallel mode in AIX will fail some of the testcheck_version.sh tests where
  it treats "exit(134) the same as if process 0 had received an abort signal.
  This is fixed and will be available in the next release. AKC - 2009/11/3

* Some tests in tools/h5repack may fail in AIX systems when -q32 mode is used.
  The error is due to insufficient memory requested. Request a large amount
  of runtime memory by setting the following environment variable for more
  memory.
     LDR_CNTRL=MAXDATA=0x20000000@DSA
  AKC - 2009/10/31

* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file is not
  existing. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the amode has
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (See bug 1468 for details.) AKC - 2009/8/11
 
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* There is a known issue in which HDF5 will change the timestamp on a file 
  simply by opening it with read/write permissions, even if the file is not
  modified in any way. This is due to the way in which HDF5 manages the file 
  superblock. A fix is currently underway and should be included in the 1.8.4
  release of HDF5. MAM - 2009/04/28

* For gcc v4.3 and v4.4, with production mode, if -O3 is used, H5Tinit.c
  would fail to compile. Actually bad H5Tinit.c is produced.  If -O (same
  as -O1) is used, H5Tinit.c compiled okay but test/dt_arith would fail.
  When -O0 (no optimizatio) is used, H5Tinit.c compilete okay and all
  tests passed. Therefore, -O0 is imposed for v4.3 and v4.4 of gcc.
  AKC - 2009/04/20

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac, 
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Added libtool version numbers to generated c++, fortran, and 
      hl libraries. MAM 2009/04/19.
    - Regenerated Makefile.ins using Automake 1.10.2. MAM 2009/04/19.
    - Added a Make target of check-all-install to test the correctness of
      installing via the prefix= or $DESTDIR options. AKC - 2009/04/14

    Library
    -------
    - Embed the content of libhdf5.settings into the hdf5 executables
      so that an "orphaned" executables can display (via the Unix
      strings command, for example) the library settings used to build
      the executables.  This is a prototype implementation. Improvement will
      be added in next release.  AKC - 2009/04/20
    - Separated "factory" free list class from block free lists. These free
      lists are dynamically created and manage blocks of a fixed size.
      H5set_free_list_limits() will use the same settings specified for block
      free lists for factory free lists. NAF - 2009/04/08
    - Added support for dense attributes to H5Ocopy. XCao/NAF - 2009/01/29
    - Added H5Pset_elink_cb and H5Pget_elink_cb functions to support a
      user-defined callback function for external link traversal.
      NAF - 2009/01/08
    - Added H5Pset_elink_acc_flags and H5Pget_elink_acc_flags functions to
      allow the user to specify the file access flags used to open the target
      file of an external link. NAF - 2009/01/08
    - Added H5Pset_chunk_cache() and H5Pget_chunk_cache() functions to allow
      individual rdcc configuration for each dataset.  Added
      H5Dget_access_plist() function to retrieve a dataset access property
      list from a dataset. NAF - 2008/11/12
    - Added H5Iis_valid() function to check if an id is valid without
      producing an error message. NAF - 2008/11/5
    - Added code to maintain a min_clean_fraction in the metadata cache when
      in serial mode. MAM - 2009/01/9

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Modified parallel tests to run with arbitrary number of processes. The
      modified tests are testphdf5 (parallel dataset access), t_chunk_alloc
      (chunk allocation), and t_posix_compliant (posix compliance). The rest of
      the parallel tests already use in the code the number of processes
      available in the communicator. (CMC - 2009/04/28)
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5diff new flag, -c, --compare, list objects that are not comparable.
      PVN - 2009/4/2 - 1368
    - h5diff new flag, -N, --nan, avoids NaNs detection. PVN - 2009/4/2
    - h5dump correctly specifies XML dtd / schema urls ADB - 2009/4/3 - 1519
    - h5repack now handles group creation order. PVN - 2009/4/2 - 1402
    - h5repack: When user doesn't specify a chunk size, h5repack now 
      defines a default chunk size as the same size of the size of the 
      hyperslab used to read the chunks. The size of the hyperslabs are 
      defined as the size of each dimension or a predefined constant, 
      whatever is smaller. This assures that the chunk read fits in the 
      chunk cache. PVN - 2008/11/21

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - Table: In version 3.0 of Table, the writing of the "NROWS" attribute 
      (used to store number of records) was deprecated. PVN - 2008/11/24

    F90 API
    -------
    - Added for the C APIs the Fortran wrappers:
          h5dget_access_plist_f
          h5iis_valid_f
          h5pset_chunk_cache_f
          h5pget_chunk_cache_f
      MSB - 2009/04/17

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.2
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - The --includedir=DIR configuration option now works as intended, and 
      can be used to specify the location to install C header files. The
      default location remains unchanged, residing at ${prefix}/include.
      MAM - 2009/03/10 - BZ #1381
    - Configure no longer removes the '-g' flag from CFLAGS when in production
      mode if it has been explicitly set in the CFLAGS environment variable 
      prior to configuration. MAM - 2009/03/09 - BZ #1401

    Library
    -------
    - Added versioning to H5Z_class_t struct to allow compatibility with 1.6
      API. NAF - 2009/04/20 - 1533
    - Fixed a problem with using data transforms with non-native types in the
      file. NAF - 2009/04/20 - 1548
    - Added direct.h include file to windows section of H5private.h 
      to fix _getcwd() warning. ADB - 2009/04/14 - 1536
    - Fixed a bug that prevented external links from working after calling
      H5close(). NAF - 2009/04/10 - 1539
    - Modified library to write cached symbol table information to the
      superblock, to allow library versions 1.3.0 to 1.6.3 to read files created
      by this version. NAF - 2009/04/08 - 1423
    - Changed skip lists to use a deterministic algorithm.  The library should
      now never call rand() or srand(). NAF - 2009/04/08 - 503
    - Fixed a bug where H5Lcopy and H5Lmove wouldn't create intermediate groups
      when that property was set. NAF - 2009/04/07 - 1526
    - Fixed a bug that caused files with a user block to grow by the size of the
      user block every time they were opened. NAF - 2009/03/26 - 1499
    - Fixed a rare problem that could occur with files using the old (pre 1.4)
      array datatype. NAF - 2009/03/23
    - Modified library to be able to open files with corrupt root group symbol
      table messages, and correct these errors if they are found.  Such files
      can only be successfully opened with write access. NAF - 2009/03/23 - 1189
    - Removed the long_long #define and replaced all instances with 
      "long long". This caused problems with third party products. All 
      currently supported compliers support the type. ADB - 2009/03/05
    - Fixed various bugs that could prevent the fill value from being written
      in certain rare cases. NAF - 2009/02/26 - 1469
    - Fixed a bug that prevented more than one dataset chunk from being cached
      at a time. NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1015
    - Fixed an assertion failure caused by opening an attribute multiple times
      through multiple file handles. NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1420
    - Fixed a problem that could prevent the user from adding attributes (or any
      object header message) in some circumstances. NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1427
    - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when an attribute was added to a
      committed datatype using the committed datatype's datatype.
      NAF - 2009/02/12
    - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when copying an object with a shared
      message in its own object header. NAF - 2009/01/29
    - Changed H5Tset_order to properly reject H5T_ORDER_NONE for most datatypes.
      NAF - 2009/01/27 - 1443
    - Fixed a bug where H5Tpack wouldn't remove trailing space from an otherwise
      packed compound type. NAF - 2009/01/14
    - Fixed up some old v2 btree assertions that get run in debug mode that
      were previously failing on compilation, and removed some of the 
      more heavily outdated and non-rewritable ones. MAM - 2008/12/15
    - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when "automatically" unmounting
      multiple files. NAF - 2008/11/17
    - H5Dset_extent: when shrinking dimensions, some chunks were not deleted.  
      PVN - 2009/01/8 

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - Fixed many problems that could occur when using h5repack with named
      datatypes. NAF - 2009/4/20 - 1516/1466
    - h5dump, h5diff, h5repack were not reading (by hyperslabs) datasets 
      that have a datatype datum size greater than H5TOOLS_BUFSIZE, a constant
      defined as 1024Kb, such as array types with large dimensions. 
      PVN - 2009/4/1 - 1501
    - h5import: By selecting a compression type, a big endian byte order 
      was being selected. PVN - 2009/3/11 - 1462
    - zip_perf.c had missing argument on one of the open() calls. Fixed.
      AKC - 2008/12/9

    F90 API
    ------
    - None

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Dimension scales: The scale index return value in H5DSiterate_scales 
      was not always incremented. PVN - 2009/4/8 - 1538

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Lite: The h5ltget_dataset_info_f function (gets information about 
      a dataset) was not correctly returning the dimension array 
                                   PVN - 2009/3/23

Known Problems
==============
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* There is a known issue in which HDF5 will change the timestamp on a file 
  simply by opening it with read/write permissions, even if the file is not
  modified in any way. This is due to the way in which HDF5 manages the file 
  superblock. A fix is currently underway and should be included in the 1.8.4
  release of HDF5. MAM - 2009/04/28

* For gcc v4.3 and v4.4, with production mode, if -O3 is used, H5Tinit.c
  would fail to compile. Actually bad H5Tinit.c is produced.  If -O (same
  as -O1) is used, H5Tinit.c compiled okay but test/dt_arith would fail.
  When -O0 (no optimizatio) is used, H5Tinit.c compilete okay and all
  tests passed. Therefore, -O0 is imposed for v4.3 and v4.4 of gcc.
  AKC - 2009/04/20

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ==================================================

  ======== Original tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh =========
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);
  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);
  KY - 2007/08/24

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platforms for serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

New Features
============

        Configuration
        -------------
        - Upgraded libtool to version 2.2.6a. (MAM - 2008/10/15).

        Library
        -------
	- Added two new public routines: H5Pget_elink_fapl() and
      	  H5Pset_elink_fapl(). (see bug #1247) (VC - 2008/10/13)
        - Improved free space tracking in file to be faster. (QAK - 2008/10/06)
        - Added 'mounted' field to H5G_info_t struct. (QAK - 2008/07/15)

        Parallel Library
        ----------------
        - None

        Tools
        -----
        - h5repack: added new options -u and -b to add a userblock to an HDF5 
          file during the repack.  (PVN - 2008/08/26)
        - h5repack: added options -t and -a to call H5Pset_alignment while 
          creating a repacked file. (PVN - 2008/08/29)
        - h5ls: added capability to traverse through external links when the -r
          (recursive) flag is given. (NAF - 2008/09/16)
        - h5ls: added -E option to enable traversal of external links.  
          h5ls will not traverse external links without this flag being set.
            (NAF - 2008/10/06)
        - h5dump: when -b flag is used without a keyword after it, binary 
          output defaults to NATIVE. MEMORY keyword was deprecated 
          and replaced by NATIVE keyword. (PVN - 2008/10/30)
        - h5diff: returns 1 when file graphs differ by any object.  
          Error return code was changed to 2 from -1.  (PVN - 2008/10/30)
        - h5import: TEXTFPE (scientific format) was deprecated. Use TEXTFP 
          instead (PVN - 2008/10/30)



        F90 API
        ------
         - Added optional parameter 'mounted' to H5Gget_info_f, 
           H5Gget_info_by_idx_f, H5Gget_info_by_name_f (MSB - 2008/09/24)
	 - Added H5Tget_native_type_f (MSB - 2008/09/30)
	 
	 
        C++ API
        ------
        - These member functions were added as wrapper for H5Rdereference to
          replace the incorrect IdComponent::dereference().
             void H5Object::dereference(H5Object& obj, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             void H5Object::dereference(H5File& h5file, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             void H5Object::dereference(Attribute& obj, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)

          In addition, these constructors were added to create the associated
          objects by way of dereference:
             DataSet(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataSet(H5File& file, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataSet(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             Group(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             Group(H5File& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             Group(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataType(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataType(H5File& file, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataType(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
          (BMR - 2008/10/29)


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
        - Intel 10.1 is supported on Mac OS X 10.5.4.
          Note:
          When Fortran is enabled, configure automatically
          disables the build of shared libraries (i.e., only
          static C and C++ HDF5 libraries will be built
          along with the static HDF5 Fortran library).
          Intel 10.1 C and C++ compilers require 
          "-no-multibyte-chars" compilation flag due to the known
          bug in the compilers.
            (EIP - 2008/10/30)


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.1 
==========================

        Configuration
        -------------
        - Fixed error with 'make check install' failing due to h5dump
          needing other tools built first. (MAM - 2008/10/15).
        - When using shared szip, it is no longer necessary to specify
          the path to the shared szip libraries in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
           (MAM - 2008/10/15).
	- The file libhdf5_fortran.settings is not installed since its content
	  is included in libhdf5.settings now. (AKC - 2008/10/21)
        - "make DESTDIR=xxx install" failed to install some tools and files
          (e.g., h5cc and fortran modules). Fixed. (AKC - 2008/10/8).

        Library
        -------
        - H5Ovisit and H5Ovisit_by_name will now properly terminate when the
            callback function returns a positive value on the starting object.
            (NAF - 2008/11/03)
        - Fixed an error where a null message could be created that was larger
            than could be written to the file.  (NAF - 2008/10/23)
        - Corrected error with family/split/multi VFD not updating driver info
            when "latest" version of the file format used. (QAK - 2008/10/14)
        - Corrected alignment+threshold errors to work correctly when metadata
            aggregation is enabled. (QAK - 2008/10/06)
        - Changed H5Fget_obj_count and H5Fget_obj_ids to ignore objects
            registered by the library for internal library use.
            (NAF - 2008/10/06)
        - Fixed potential memory leak during compound conversion.
            (NAF - 2008/10/06)
        - Changed the return value of H5Fget_obj_count from INT to SSIZE_T. 
            Also changed the return value of H5Fget_obj_ids from HERR_T to 
            SSIZE_T and the type of the parameter MAX_OBJS from INT to SIZE_T. 
            (SLU - 2008/09/26)
        - Fixed an issue that could cause data to be improperly overwritten
            during compound type conversion.  (NAF - 2008/09/19)
        - Fixed pointer alignment violations that could occur during vlen
            conversion.  (NAF - 2008/09/16)
        - Fixed problem where library could cause a segmentation fault when
            an invalid location ID was given to H5Giterate(). (QAK - 2008/08/19)
        - Fixed improper shutdown when objects have reference count > 1.  The
            library now tracks reference count due to the application separately
            from that due to internal library routines.  (NAF - 2008/08/19)
        - Fixed assertion failure caused by incorrect array datatype version.
            (NAF - 2008/08/08)
        - Fixed an issue where mount point traversal would fail when using
            multiple handles for the child.  (NAF - 2008/08/07)
        - Fixed an issue where mount points were inaccessible when using 
            multiple file handles for the parent. The mount table is now in 
            the shared file structure (the parent pointer is still in the 
            top structure).  (NAF - 2008/08/07)
        - Fixed assertion failure caused by incorrect array datatype version.
            (NAF - 2008/08/04)
        - Fixed issue where a group could have a file mounted on it twice.
            (QAK - 2008/07/15)
        - When an attribute was opened twice and data was written with 
            one of the handles, the file didn't have the data. It happened 
            because each handle had its own object structure, and the empty 
            one overwrote the data with fill value.  This is fixed by making 
            some attribute information like the data be shared in the 
            attribute structure.  (SLU - 2008/07/07)
        - Fixed a Windows-specific issue in the ohdr test which was causing 
            users in some timezones to get false errors. This a deficiency in 
            the Windows mktime() function, and has been handled properly.  
            (SJW  - 2008/06/19)

        Parallel Library
        ----------------
        - None

        Tools
        -----
        - h5dump now checks for uniqueness of committed datatypes.
            (NAF - 2008/10/15)
        - Fixed unnecessary indentation of committed datatypes in h5dump.
            (NAF - 2008/10/15)
	- Fixed bugs in h5stat: segmemtation fault when printing groups and
          print warning message when traversal of objects is unsuccessful.
          (see bug #1253) (VC- 2008/10/13)
        - Fixed bug in h5ls that prevented relative group listings (like
            "h5ls foo.h5/bar") from working correctly (QAK - 2008/06/03)
        - h5dump: when doing binary output (-b), the stdout printing of 
             attributes was done incorrectly. Removed printing of attributes 
             when doing binary output. (PVN - 2008/06/05)


        F90 API
        ------
        - h5sselect_elements_f: Added additional operators H5S_SELECT_APPEND 
            and H5S_SELECT_PREPEND (MSB - 2008/09/30)
	- h5sget_select_elem_pointlist: Fixed list of returned points by 
            rearranging the point list correctly by accounting for C 
            conventions. (MSB - 2008/09/30)
        - h5sget_select_hyper_blocklist_f: Fixed error in transposed dimension 
            of arrays.(MSB - 2008/9/30)
        - h5sget_select_bounds_f: Swapped array bounds to account for C and 
            Fortran reversed array notation (MSB - 2008/9/30)
	- Changed to initializing string to a blank character instead of a 
            null type in tH5P.f90 to fix compiling error using AIX 5.3.0 
            (MSB - 2008/7/29)
        - Fixed missing commas in H5test_kind.f90 detected by NAG compiler 
            (MSB - 2008/7/29)
        - Fixed passing and array to a scalar in tH5A_1_8.f90 detected by 
            NAG compiler (MSB - 2008/7/29)
	- Added the ability of the test programs to use the status of 
            HDF5_NOCLEANUP to determine if the *.h5 files should be removed 
            or not after the tests are completed (MSB - 2008/10/1)
	- In nh5tget_offset_c: (MSB 9/12/2008)
           If offset was equal to 0 it returned the error code of -1, 
           this was changed to return an error code of -1 when the offset 
           value is < 0.
        - Uses intrinsic Fortran function SIZEOF if available when detecting 
           type of INTEGERs and REALs in H5test_kind.f90 (MSB - 2008/9/3)
        - Put the DOUBLE PRECISION interfaces in a separate module and 
           added a USE statement for the module. The interfaces are 
           included/excluded depending on the state of FORTRAN_DEFAULT_REAL
           is DBLE_F which detects if the default REAL is DOUBLE PRECISION.
           This allows the library to be compiled with -r8 Fortran flag 
           without the user needing to edit the source code. 
           (MSB - 200/8/27)
        - Enable building shared library for fortran by adding the flag -fPIC 
          to the compile flags for versions of Intel Fortran compiler >=9
           (MSB  - 2008/8/26)

        C++ API
        ------
        - Fixed a design bug which allowed an Attribute object to create/modify
          attributes (bugzilla #1068).  The API class hierarchy was revised
          to address the problem.  Classes AbstractDS and Attribute are moved
          out of H5Object.  Class Attribute now multiply inherits from
          IdComponent and AbstractDs and class DataSet from H5Object and
          AbstractDs.  In addition, the data member IdComponent::id was
          moved into subclasses: Attribute, DataSet, DataSpace, DataType,
          H5File, Group, and PropList. (BMR - 2008/05/20)
        - IdComponent::dereference was incorrect and replaced as described
          in "New Features" section.

Known Problems
==============
* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5

  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);
  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);

  KY - 2007/08/24

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platforms for serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============

        Configuration
        -------------
        - The lib/libhdf5.settings file contains much more configure
          information. (AKC - 2008/05/18)

        - The new configure option "--disable-sharedlib-rpath" disables 
          embedding the '-Wl,-rpath' information into executables when 
          shared libraries are produced, and instead solely relies on the 
          information in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (MAM - 2008/05/15)

        - Configuration suite now uses Autoconf 2.61, Automake 1.10.1, and 
          Libtool 2.2.2 (MAM - 2008/05/01)

        Source code distribution
        ========================

        Library
        -------
        - None

        Parallel Library
        ----------------
        - None

        Tools
        -----
        - h5repack: Reinstated the -i and -o command line flags to specify 
          input and output files.  h5repack now understands both the old
          syntax (with -i and -o) and the new syntax introduced in Release
          1.8.0.  (PVN - 2008/05/23)
        - h5dump: Added support for external links, displaying the object that 
          an external link points to. (PVN - 2008/05/12)
        - h5dump: Added an option, -m, to allow user-defined formatting in the 
          output of floating point numbers. (PVN - 2008/05/06)
        - h5dump, in output of the -p option: Added effective data compression 
          ratio to the dataset storage layout output when a compression filter 
          has been applied to a dataset.  (PVN - 2008/05/01)

        F90 API
        ------
        New H5A, H5G, H5L, H5O, and H5P APIs to enable 1.8 features were
        added. See "Release 1.8.1 (current release) versus Release 1.8.0" in 
        the document "HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release"
        (http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/Changes.html) for the 
        complete list of the new APIs.

        C++ API
        ------
        - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
        - Both serial and parallel HDF5 are supported for the Red Storm machine 
          which is a Cray XT3 system.

        - The Fortran library will work correctly if compiled with the -i8 
          flag.  This has been tested with the g95, PGI and Intel Fortran 
          compilers.


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.0 
==========================

        Configuration
        -------------
        - None

        Source code distribution
        ========================

        Library
        -------
        - Chunking:  Chunks greater than 4GB are disallowed. 
          (QAK - 2008/05/16)
        - Fixed the problem with searching for a target file when following 
          an external link.  The search pattern will depend on whether the 
          target file's pathname is an absolute or a relative path. 
          Please see the H5Lcreate_external description in the "HDF5 
          Reference Manual" (http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5L.html).
          (VC - 2008/04/08)
        - Fixed possible file corruption bug when encoding datatype
          descriptions for compound datatypes whose size was between
          256 and 511 bytes and the file was opened with the "use the
          latest format" property enabled (with H5Pset_libver_bounds).
          (QAK - 2008/03/13)
        - Fixed bug in H5Aget_num_attrs() routine to correctly handle an 
          invalid location identifier.  (QAK - 2008/03/11)

        Parallel Library
        ----------------
        - None

        Tools
        -----
        - Fixed bug in h5diff that prevented datasets and attributes with
          variable-length string elements from comparing correctly.
          (QAK - 2008/02/28)
        - Fixed bug in h5dump that caused binary output to be made only for 
          the first dataset, when several datasets were requested.
          (PVN - 2008/04/07)

        F90 API
        ------
        - The h5tset(get)_fields subroutines were missing the parameter to 
          specify a sign position; fixed.  (EIP - 2008/05/23)
        - Many APIs were fixed to work with the 8-byte integers in Fortran vs.
          4-byte integers in C. This change is trasparent to user applications.

        C++ API
        ------
        - The class hierarchy was revised to address the problem reported
          in bugzilla #1068, Attribute should not be derived from base
          class H5Object.  Classes AbstractDS was moved out of H5Object.
          Class Attribute now multiply inherits from IdComponent and
          AbstractDs and class DataSet from H5Object and AbstractDs.
          In addition, data member IdComponent::id was moved into subclasses:
          Attribute, DataSet, DataSpace, DataType, H5File, Group, and PropList.
          (BMR - 2008/05/20)
	- IdComponent::dereference was incorrect; it was changed from:
		void IdComponent::dereference(IdComponent& obj, void* ref)
	  to:
		void H5Object::dereference(H5File& h5file, void* ref)
		void H5Object::dereference(H5Object& obj, void* ref)
	  (BMR - 2008/05/20)
        - Revised Attribute::write and Attribute::read wrappers to handle
          memory allocation/deallocation properly. (bugzilla 1045)
          (BMR - 2008/05/20)

Known Problems
==============
* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh will fail on
  the test "Testing h5ls -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5" fails.  This test is
  expected to fail and exit with a non-zero code but the yod command does
  not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always returns 0 if it
  can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects a non-zero for
  this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has failed when it
  receives 0 from yod.  To bypass this problem for now, change the following
  lines in the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh.
  ======== Original =========
  # The following combination of arguments is expected to return an error message
  # and return value 1
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Skip the test =========
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== end of bypass ========
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);
  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);

  KY - 2007/08/24

* For SNL, spirit/liberty/thunderbird: The serial tests pass but parallel
  tests failed with MPI-IO file locking message. AKC - 2007/6/25

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* Configuring with --enable-debug=all produces compiler errors on most
  platforms:  Users who want to run HDF5 in debug mode should use
  --enable-debug rather than --enable-debug=all to enable debugging
  information on most modules.

* On Mac OS 10.4, test/dt_arith.c has some errors in conversion from long
  double to (unsigned) long long and from (unsigned) long long to long double. 

* On Altix SGI with Intel 9.0, testmeta.c would not compile with -O3
  optimization flag.

* On VAX, the Scaleoffset filter is not supported.  The Scaleoffset filter 
  supports only the IEEE standard for floating-point data; it cannot be applied 
  to HDF5 data generated on VAX. 

* On Cray X1, a lone colon on the command line of h5dump --xml (as in
  the testh5dumpxml.sh script) is misinterpereted by the operating system
  and causes an error.

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on the AMD 
  Opteron processor, there is a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  
  The library failed in several tests, all related to the MULTI driver.  
  The problem has been reported to the vendor.  

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platforms for serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.

* The ./dsets tests fail on the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The HDF5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Not all platforms behave correctly with Szip's shared libraries. Szip is
  disabled in these cases, and a message is relayed at configure time. Static
  libraries should be working on all systems that support Szip and should be
  used when shared libraries are unavailable. 

  There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build the HDF5 
  Fortran library, compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 
  and fflush2.f90 complaining about the exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error).

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run 
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as 
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.  

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to 
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after 
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it 
  for your installation.  

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item 
  on the command line which executes the the test.  The script then 
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF5 make files and test scipts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the 
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to 
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can 
  prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.

* H5Ocopy() does not copy reg_ref attributes correctly when shared-message
  is turn on. The value of the reference in the destination attriubte is
  wrong. This H5Ocopy problem will affect the h5copy tool.

* In the C++ API, it appears that there are bugs in Attribute::write/read
  and DataSet::write/read for fixed- and variable-len strings.  The problems
  are being worked on and a patch will be provided when the fixes are
  available.

           H5Lite (H5LT), H5Image (H5IM), and H5Table (H5TB)
       New and improved tools
       And more...

       http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/WhatsNew180.html


    New APIs associated with these features, other interface changes 
    (e.g., ENUM and struct definitions), and new library configuration flags
    are listed in the "Release 1.8.0 (current release) versus Release 1.6.x" 
    section of "HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release."

        http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/Changes.html

Compatibility
-------------
    Many HDF5 users and user communities have existing applications that 
    they may wish to port to Release 1.8.0.  Alternatively, some users may 
    wish to take advantage of Release 1.8.0's improved performance without
    having to port such applications.  To facilitate managing application
    compatibility and porting applications from release to release, the HDF 
    Team has implemented the following features:
        Individually-configurable macros that selectively map common 
            interface names to the old and new interfaces
        Library configuration options to configure the macro mappings

    Two related documents accompany this release:
        "API Compatibility Macros in HDF5" discusses the specifics of the 
        new individually-configurable macros and library configuration 
        options.
        http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/APICompatMacros.html
 
        "New Features in HDF5 Release 1.8.0 and Backward/Forward Format
        Compatibility Issues" discusses each new feature with regard to 
        its impact on format compatibility.

Removed Feature
===============
The stream virtual file driver (H5FD_STREAM) have been removed in this 
release. This affects the functions H5Pset_fapl_stream and H5Pget_fapl_stream 
and the constant H5FD_STREAM.

This virtual file driver will be available at 
http://hdf5-addons.origo.ethz.ch/. Note that at the time of this release, 
the transition is still in progress; the necessary integration tools may 
not be available when HDF5 Release 1.8.0 first comes out.


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - Support for Open VMS 7.3 was added.


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.0 
==========================
    This release contains numerous bug fixes. For details, see the 
    "Changes from 1.6.0 to 1.8.0-rc3" section of the HISTORY.txt file for
    this release.

Known Problems
==============
* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);

  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);

  KY - 2007/08/24

* For SNL, spirit/liberty/thunderbird: The serial tests pass but parallel
  tests failed with MPI-IO file locking message. AKC - 2007/6/25

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For SNL, Red Storm: Only parallel HDF5 is supported.  The serial tests pass
  when run against the parallel library; the parallel tests also pass, but
  with lots of non-fatal error messages.

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* On SUN 5.10 C++, testing fails in the "Testing Shared Datatypes with 
  Attributes" test. 

* Configuring with --enable-debug=all produces compiler errors on most
  platforms:  Users who want to run HDF5 in debug mode should use
  --enable-debug rather than --enable-debug=all to enable debugging
  information on most modules.

* On Mac OS 10.4, test/dt_arith.c has some errors in conversion from long
  double to (unsigned) long long and from (unsigned) long long to long double. 

* On Altix SGI with Intel 9.0, testmeta.c would not compile with -O3
  optimization flag.

* On VAX, the Scaleoffset filter is not supported. The filter cannot be 
  applied to HDF5 data generated on VAX. The Scaleoffset filter only supports 
  the IEEE standard for floating-point data.

* On Cray X1, a lone colon on the command line of h5dump --xml (as in
  the testh5dumpxml.sh script) is misinterpereted by the operating system
  and causes an error.

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on the AMD 
  Opteron processor, there is a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  
  The library failed in several tests, all related to the MULTI driver.  
  The problem has been reported to the vendor.  

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.

* The ./dsets tests fail on the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The HDF5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Not all platforms behave correctly with Szip's shared libraries. Szip is
  disabled in these cases, and a message is relayed at configure time. Static
  libraries should be working on all systems that support Szip and should be
  used when shared libraries are unavailable. 

  There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build the HDF5 
  Fortran library, compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 
  and fflush2.f90 complaining about the exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error).

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run 
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as 
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.  

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to 
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after 
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it 
  for your installation.  

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item 
  on the command line which executes the the test.  The script then 
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF5 make files and test scipts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the 
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to 
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can 
  can prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.

* H5Ocopy() does not copy reg_ref attributes correctly when shared-message
  is turn on. The value of the reference in the destination attriubte is
  wrong. This H5Ocopy problem will affect the h5copy tool.

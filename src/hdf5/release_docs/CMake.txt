* Installing and Using HDF5 C/C++ Library with CMake                   *
************************************************************************

Notes: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly install 
       and use the HDF5 library and tools from the HDF5 binary package using
       the CMake tools.
       
       1. On windows, run the HDF5 installer. Note that there is a static and
          a dynamic dll version for HDF5. At this time, the default install
          location is the same; Program Files\HDFGroup\HDF5\1.8.7. By default,
          the bin folder is added to the path. If you wish to use the tools,
          the bin\tools folder will need to be added manually.
          
       2. Installing both static and dynamic versions will require installation
          in seprate folders, so that the CMake FindPackage() function will work
          properly. Please adjust your product CMakeLists.txt file to locate
          the correct library.
          
       3. When selecting a new location, the windows installer will append the 
          HDFGroup and HDF5 folders. 
       
       NOTES:
         1. Using CPack for installing and using HDF5 is under active development. 
            While we have attempted to provide error-free files, please 
            understand that development with CPack has not been extensively 
            tested outside of HDF. The CMake/CPack specific files may change
            before the next release.
            
         2. CMake was originally introduced to support development on Windows, 
            however it should be usable on any system where CMake is supported. 
            Please send us any comments on how CMake support can be improved on 
            any system. Visit the KitWare site for more information about CMake.

Notes: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly build 
       HDF5 library and tools from the HDF5 source code package using the 
       CMake tools.
       
       More information about using CMake can be found at the KitWare site, 
       www.cmake.org.
         
       CMake uses the command line, however the visual CMake tool is 
       recommended for the configuration step. The steps are similiar for
       all the operating systems supported by CMake.
       
       NOTES:
         1. Using CMake for building and using HDF5 is under active development. 
            While we have attempted to provide error-free files, please 
            understand that development with CMake has not been extensively

         3. If you are building HDF5 on Windows, do NOT use or execute any
            files from the windows folder.
            
         4. Build and test results can be submitted to our CDash server at:
            cdash.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu. 
            Please read the HDF and CDash document at:
            www.hdfgroup.org/CDash/HowToSubmit.

                            Preconditions                                                           
========================================================================                          

   1. We suggest you obtain the latest CMake for windows from the Kitware
      web site. The HDF5 1.8.x product requires CMake version 2.8.4.                     
                                                                         
   2. If you plan to use Zlib or Szip;
      A. Download the packages and install them
         in a central location. For example on Windows, create a folder extlibs 
         and install the packages there. Windows users should also read Section V
         in INSTALL_Windows.txt.
      B. Use source packages from a SVN server by adding the following CMake 
         options:
            HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="SVN"
            ZLIB_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/zlib/trunk"
            SZIP_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/szip/trunk"
         where "some_location" is the URL to the SVN repository.
      C. Use source packages from a compressed file by adding the following CMake 
         options:
            HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="TGZ"
            ZLIB_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlib_src.ext"
            SZIP_TGZ_NAME:STRING="szip_src.ext"
            TGZ_PATH:STRING="some_location"
         where "some_location" is the URL or full path to the compressed file and 
         ext is the type of compression file.
                                    
                                                                         
========================================================================
          Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with CMake
========================================================================

   1. Run CMake

      The CMake executable is named "cmake-gui.exe" on Windows and should be
      available in your Start menu. For Linux, UNIX, and Mac users the
      executable is named "cmake-gui" and can be found where CMake was 
      installed. 
      Specify the source and build directories. It is recommemded that you 
      choose a build directory different then the source directory 
      (for example on Windows, if the source is at c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5, then
      use c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\build or c:\MyHDFstuff\build\hdf5). 
      
      OPTIONAL:
        Users can perform the configuration step without using the visual cmake-gui
        program. We use the file cacheinit.cmake in the config/cmake folder for
        our testing. This file enables all the basic options and we turn specific 
        options on or off for testing using the following command line within the build
        directory:
        
        cmake -C <sourcepath>/config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake -G "<generator>"  [-D<options>]  <sourcepath>
        
        Where <generator> is    
            * Borland Makefiles
            * MSYS Makefiles
            * MinGW Makefiles
            * NMake Makefiles
            * Unix Makefiles
            * Visual Studio 10
            * Visual Studio 10 Win64
            * Visual Studio 6
            * Visual Studio 7
            * Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003
            * Visual Studio 8 2005
            * Visual Studio 8 2005 Win64
            * Visual Studio 9 2008
            * Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64

        <options> is:
            * SZIP_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to szip includes directory>
            * SZIP_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to szip/library file>
            * ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to szip includes directory>
            * ZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to szip/library file>
            * <HDF5OPTION>:BOOL=[ON | OFF]

        <cacheinit.cmake> is:
            # This is the CMakeCache file.
            ########################
            # EXTERNAL cache entries
            ########################
            SET (BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON CACHE BOOL "Build Shared Libraries" FORCE)
            SET (BUILD_TESTING ON CACHE BOOL "Build HDF5 Unit Testing" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_BUILD_CPP_LIB ON CACHE BOOL "Build HDF5 C++ Library" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_BUILD_EXAMPLES ON CACHE BOOL "Build HDF5 Library Examples" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_BUILD_FORTRAN ON CACHE BOOL "Build FORTRAN support" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_BUILD_HL_LIB ON CACHE BOOL "Build HIGH Level HDF5 Library" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_BUILD_TOOLS ON CACHE BOOL "Build HDF5 Tools" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_DISABLE_COMPILER_WARNINGS OFF CACHE BOOL "Disable compiler warnings" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_ENABLE_HSIZET ON CACHE BOOL "Enable datasets larger than memory" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL OFF CACHE BOOL "Enable parallel build (requires MPI)" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_ENABLE_SZIP_ENCODING ON CACHE BOOL "Use SZip Encoding" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_ENABLE_SZIP_SUPPORT ON CACHE BOOL "Use SZip Filter" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_ENABLE_Z_LIB_SUPPORT ON CACHE BOOL "Enable Zlib Filters" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_USE_H5DUMP_PACKED_BITS ON CACHE BOOL "Use the PACKED BITS feature in h5dump" FORCE)
            SET (HDF5_ENABLE_COVERAGE OFF CACHE BOOL "Enable code coverage for Libraries and Programs" FORCE)

   2. Configure the cache settings

      2.1  Click the Configure button. If this is the first time you are 
           running cmake-gui in this directory, you will be prompted for the 
           generator you wish to use (for example on Windows, Visual Studio 9 2008). 
           CMake will read in the CMakeLists.txt files from the source directory and 
           display options for the HDF5 project. After the first configure you 
           can adjust the cache settings and/or specify locations of other programs.
      
           Any conflicts or new values will be highlighted by the configure
           process in red. Once you are happy with all the settings and there are no 
           more values in red, click the Generate button to produce the appropriate 
           build files. 
      
           On Windows, if you are using a Visual Studio generator, the solution and 
           project files will be created in the build folder.
      
           On linux, if you are using the Unix Makefiles generator, the Makefiles will
           be created in the build folder.

      2.2  Alternative command line example on Windows in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\build directory:
      
               cmake -C ../config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" \
               -DHDF5_ENABLE_SZIP_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF -DHDF5_ENABLE_Z_LIB_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF ..

   3. Build HDF5
   
      On Windows, you can build HDF5 using either the Visual Studio Environment 
      or the command line. The command line is used on linux, Unix, and Mac.

      To build from the command line, navigate to your build directory and
      execute the following;
          
              cmake --build . --config {Debug | Release}     
              
      NOTE: "--config {Debug | Release}" may be optional on your platform. We
            recommend choosing either Debug or Release on Windows.                                                                                      
             
      3.1  If you wish to use the Visual Studio environment, open the solution 
           file in your build directory. Be sure to select either Debug or 
           Release and build the solution.
             
      3.2.1  The external libraries (zlib and szip) can be configured
           to allow building the libraries by downloading from a SVN repository.
           The option is 'HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT'; by adding the following
           configuration option:
               -DHDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="SVN"
               
           The options to control the SVN URL (config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file):
               ZLIB_SVN_URL:STRING="http://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/zlib/trunk"
               SZIP_SVN_URL:STRING="http://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/szip/trunk"
           These should be changed to your location.
           
      3.2.2  Or the external libraries (zlib and szip) can be configured
           to allow building the libraries by using a compressed file.
           The option is 'HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT'; by adding the following
           configuration option:
               -DHDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="TGZ"
               
           The options to control the SVN URL (config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file):
               ZLIB_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlib_src.ext"
               SZIP_TGZ_NAME:STRING="szip_src.ext"
               TGZ_PATH:STRING="some_location"
            where "some_location/xxxx_src.ext" is the URL or full path to the 
            compressed file and where ext is the type of the compression file like:
               .bz2, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .zip

   4. Test HDF5.

      To test the build, navigate to your build directory and execute;
      
              ctest . -C {Debug | Release}
              
      NOTE: "-C {Debug | Release}" may be optional on your platform. We
            recommend choosing either Debug or Release to match the build
            step on Windows.                                                                                      

   5. Packaging HDF5
   
      To package the build into a simple installer using the NullSoft installer NSIS
      on Windows, or into compressed files (.tar.gz, .sh, .zip), use the CPack tool.

      To package the build, navigate to your build directory and execute;
      
              cpack -C {Debug | Release} CPackConfig.cmake
      
      NOTE: We have just introduced the packaging capability and it has not been 
            extensively tested. Please send us comments on how it can be improved.
           
   6. The files that support building HDF5 with CMake are all the files in the 
      config/cmake folder, the CMakeLists.txt files in each source folder, and 
      CTestConfig.cmake. CTestConfig.cmake is specific to the internal testing 
      performed by The HDF Group. It should be altered for the users 
      installation and needs.

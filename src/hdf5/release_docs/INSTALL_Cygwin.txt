************************************************************************
         HDF5 Build and Install Instructions for Cygwin
************************************************************************

Preconditions:
--------------

1. Installed Cygwin 1.7.5 or higher

   To install the Cygwin net release, go to http://www.cygwin.com and 
   click on "Install or update now!" icon. This will download a GUI 
   installer called setup.txt which can be run to download a complete 
   Cygwin installation via the internet. Then follow the instructions 
   on each screen to install Cygwin.

   Cygwin uses packages to manage installing various software. Users can 
   choose to install or uninstall certain packages by running setup.exe.
   http://www.cygwin.com/packages/ provides detailed information about 
   Cygwin packages.

   To build HDF5 on Cygwin, Devel package (including gcc,gcc-g++,
   gcc-g77, and gcc-java compiles, and gdb tool) should be installed.

2. Compilers Installed

   2.1 C/C++ Compilers HDF5-1.8 Supported

       gcc (4.3.4), which includes:
            gcc4-core    : C compiler
            gcc4-g++     : C++ compiler
            gcc4-fortran : fortran compiler

   2.2 Using Compilers Not Supported
       
       The compilers in 2.1 are supported and tested by HDF 
       group. Any other compilers may still work but they are not 
       guaranteed by HDF group.

       If users want to use other compilers except those in 2.1,
       try to set the following variables to override the default 
       choices.
       
       CXX : C++ compiler command
       FC  : Fortran compiler command

       For example, if users want to use pgf90 as fortran compiler, then 

            setenv FC pgf90
           
3. HDF5 Dependencies

   3.1 Zlib

       zlib-1.2.2 or later is supported and tested on Cygwin.

   3.2 Szip
       The HDF5 library has a predefined compression filter that uses
       the extended-Rice lossless compression algorithm for chunked
       datatsets. For more information about Szip compression and 
       license terms see 
       http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc_resource/SZIP/index.html.
      
       The latest supported public release of SZIP is available from
       ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/2.0. Binary distribution can be 
       found under ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/2.0/bin/cygwin


Install HDF5 on Cygwin
----------------------

1. Get HDF5 source code package
   Users can download HDF5 source code package from HDF website
   (http://hdfgroup.org). 
     
2. Unpacking the distribution

   The HDF5 source code is distributed in a variety of formats which
   can be unpacked with the following commands, each of which creates 
   an `hdf5-1.8.5' directory.

   2.1 Non-compressed tar archive (*.tar)

            $ tar xf hdf5-1.8.5.tar

   2.2 Gzip'd tar archive (*.tar.gz)

            $ gunzip < hdf5-1.8.5.tar.gz | tar xf -

   2.3 Bzip'd tar archive (*.tar.bz2)

            $ bunzip2 < hdf5-1.8.5.tar.bz2 | tar xf - 

2. Setup Environment

    In Cygwin, most compilers and setting are automatically detected during
    the configure script.  However, if you are building Fortran we recommend 
    that you explicitly set the "FC" variable in your environment to use the 
    gfortran compiler.  For example, issue the command:
    
            $ export FC=gfortran
            
4. Configuring 
     
   Notes: See detailed information in hdf5/release_docs/INSTALL, 
          part 5. Full installation instructions for source 
          distributions

   The host configuration file for cygwin i686-pc-cygwin is located 
   in the `config' directory and are based on architecture name, 
   vendor name, and operating system which are displayed near the 
   beginning of the `configure' output. The host config file influences
   the behavior of configure by setting or augmenting shell variables. 
     
   In short,
     
   To configure HDF5 C Library, using 
            
            $ ./configure
                   
   To configure HDF5 C/C++ Library, using

            $ ./configure --enable-cxx
                   
   To configure HDF5 C/Fortran Library, using

            $ ./configure --enable-fortran
                   
   To configure HDF5 C with Szip library, using

            $ ./configure  --with-szlib="path to szlib"
           
       For example, if szip library was installed in the directory 
       /cygdrive/c/szip, which is parent directory of "include" and
       "lib", then the following command will configure HDF5 C library 
       with szip enabled:
           
            $ ./configure --with-szlib=/cygdrive/c/szip
                   
   To configure HDF5 C without Zlib,
     
       To disable zlib, using

           $ ./configure --without-zlib
           
   Two ways to configure HDF5 C with specified Zlib
     
      Using

           $ ./configure --with-zlib=INCDIR,LIBDIR

       For example, if the zlib library is installed in
       /cygdrive/c/usr, which is the parent directory of directories
       "include" and "lib", 

 $ ./configure --with-zlib=/cygdrive/c/usr/include,/cygdrive/c/usr/lib

      Through the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS Variables
           
       For example, if zlib was installed in the directory 
       /cygdrive/c/usr then using the following command to configure 
       HDF5 with zib

           $ CPPFLAGS=-I/cygdrive/c/usr/include \
           $ LDFLAGS=-L/cygdrive/c/usr/lib \
           $ ./configure

    To specify the installation directories, using 

            $ ./configure --prefix="path for installation"
                 
       By default, HDF5 library, header files, examples, and 
       support programs will be installed in /usr/local/lib,
       /usr/local/include, /usr/local/doc/hdf5/examples, and
       /usr/local/bin. To use a path other than /usr/local specify 
       the path with the `--prefix=PATH' switch as in the above
       command.

    Combination of Switches 

       All of the above switches can be combined together. For 
       example, if users want to configure HDF5 C/C++/Fortran 
       library with szip library enabled, with zlib library at 
       /cygdrive/c/usr/, and install HDF5 into directory 
       /cygdrive/c/hdf5 using gcc/g++ as C/C++ compiler and g95
       as fortran compiler
     
           $ ./configure
             --with-szlib=/cygdrive/c/szip
             --with-zlib=/cygdrive/c/usr/include,/cygdrive/c/usr/lib
             --prefix=/cygdrive/c/hdf5
             --enable-cxx
             --enable-fortran 
             <"If no more switches, then hit Enter">

       Notes: The command format above is for readilibity. In practice,
              please type in the command above with at least one
              space between each line, No "Enter" until users finish 
              the switches and want to run the configure. 

 
     or do it through CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables:
     
           $ CPPFLAGS=-I/cygdrive/c/usr/include \
           $ LDFLAGS=-L/cygdrive/c/usr/lib \

           $ ./configure
             --with-szlib=/cygdrive/c/szip
             --prefix=/cygdrive/c/hdf5
             --enable-cxx
             --enable-fortran 
             <"If no more switches, then hit Enter">
                          
5. Make and Make Check

   After configuration is done successfully, run the following series of
   commands to build, test and install HDF5
    
            $ make          > "output file name"
            $ make check    > "output file name"
            
   Before run "make install", check output file for "make check", there
   should be no failures at all.

6. Make Install

            $ make install  > "output file name"
   
     
7. Check installed HDF5 library

   After step 6, go to your installation directory, there should be 
   three subdirectories: "bin" "include" and "lib".

8. Known Problems 
   
   Shared libraries can not be built on Cygwin In release 1.8.

The following instructions assume that the HDF5 binary code package from
HDF website (http://hdfgroup.org) is used.

Warnings:
Please read CAREFULLY about the following preconditions and notes first.

========================================================================
                          Preconditions and Notes
========================================================================

Preconditions:

   1. Installed Microsoft Visual Studio.  This document is written for Visual
      Studio 2008. Express Editions may work with the project files
      but not from the command line. We do not support the Express Editions.
   
   2. (Optional) Installed Intel Compiler 10.1 or 11.1 if you want to use HDF5 
      Fortran libraries.
      
   3. Install Winzip or 7-zip for extracting source tarball.

      Note: 1. 7zip is an open-source alternative to WinZip.  Some of the
            advanced functionality is disabled in WinZip unless you buy the
            software.  With 7zip, most of this functionality is included for
            free.
            
   5. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library.  For example:

            c:\                              (any drive)
            MyHDFstuff\                      (any folder name)

   6. Download the hdf5-1.8.x binary code package and use 7zip or WinZip to
      extract the HDF5 package into c:\MyHDFstuff.  This creates a directory 
      called 'hdf5-1.8.x' under MyHDFstuff which contains several files and 
      directories.  Rename "hdf5-1.8.x" to "hdf5".

   7. HDF5 provide options to do in-memory compression  within HDF5 library.  
      Currently, two external compression libraries Zlib and Szip can be used 
      with HDF5.

      7.1 HDF5 uses Zlib version 1.2.5 for compression and Zlib is 
          distributed with HDF5 library in 1.8.x release.

      7.2 HDF5 uses Szip version 2.1 for compression and Szip compression 
          software is provided with HDF5 products in 1.8.x release.

          Please note that Szip is not a totally open-source free software.  
          For licensing issue of Szip, please check "Licensing terms" at
          http://hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/index.html.

      Szip compression feature inside HDF5 is enabled by default.

   8. Define the following environment variables:

        HDF5_EXT_ZLIB
        HDF5_EXT_SZIP

      In this section, Zlib and Szip compression packages are assumed to be 
      used.  Please read Section V as well as this section if you do not want 
      to use compression feature inside HDF5.

      To define these environment variables:

      Click "Start", click "Control Panel", and then double-click "System".  
      On the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables".

      If you are logged on as administrator to the local computer AND want to 
      let all other users use these two environment variables, click "New" 
      under "System Variables" box; otherwise, click "New" under "User 
      Variables" box.

      In the New Variable window, set "Variable name" as HDF5_EXT_ZLIB and 
      "Variable value" as zlib1.lib, then click OK.

      Similarly, you can set:

      HDF5_EXT_SZIP environment variable as szip.lib

      Notes:

         a. You will have to close and reopen running programs for the new 
            environment variable settings to take effect.

         b. c:\zlib\zlib1.dll and c:\szip\dll\szip.dll should be copied 
            into a location that the application can find.

   9. Set up path for libraries and headers

      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio and go to "Tools" and select "Options", 
      find "Projects", and then "VC++ Directories".
      
      9.1 If you are building on 64-bit Windows, find the "Platform" dropdown
          and select "x64".

      9.2 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Include files", if you 
          can not find your HDF5 header path (for example, 
          c:\MyHDFstuff\include) from the directory list, add the 
          header path (c:\MyHDFstuff\include) to the included 
          directories.

      9.3 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files".  If you 
          cannot find your HDF5 library path (for example, 
          c:\MyHDFstuff\dll for dynamic-shared and c:\MyHDFstuff\lib for static) 
          from the directory list, add the library 
          path (c:\MyHDFstuff\dll or c:\MyHDFstuff\lib) to the library directories.
          
      9.4 If building Fortran applications, you will also need to setup the path
          for the Intel Fortran compiler.  Please see Section VI.

Notes:

   1. HDF4-related tools are not built and released with HDF5 library packages 
      any more. To obtain HDF4 related tools, please check
      http://hdfgroup.org/h4toh5/ and ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/h4toh5

   2. For Fortran users, Intel Fortran Compiler 10.1 is currently supported
      -- please see Section VI. Intel Compiler 11.1 can be used but the project files
      must be upgraded within the Visual Studio IDE. 
      
   3. The szip and zlib dlls must be in the PATH for using the tools (including static).

          writetestdll

   3. Invoke a command prompt window and run the batch file InstallExamples.bat 
      which resides in the top level directory (c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5examples).  This file 
      creates new directories, examplesREL, examplesRELDLL in the 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5examples\examples directory and places 
      all the executables in it.

   4. We provide a batch file named testExamples.bat and an expected examples 
      tests output file named testExamples_exp_output.txt in 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\examples directory for you to test HDF5 C examples.

      testExamples.bat batch file has options:

         testExamples release     -- for release version

         testExamples release dll -- for release DLL version

      Invoke a command prompt and run testExamples.bat with appropriate options.
      You should get "All HDF5 C examples tests passed." when the C examples are
      built successfully.  Otherwise, the difference between the expected 
      outputs and actual outputs will be given.

   3. Invoke a command prompt window and run the batch file 
      InstallcppExamples.bat which resides in the top level directory
      (c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5examples).  This file creates new directories,
      cppexamplesREL, cppexamplesRELDLL in the 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5examples\c++\examples directory and places all 
      the executables in it.

   4. We provide a batch file named testcppExamples.bat in
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5examples\c++\examples directory for you to test HDF5 C++ 
      examples.

      testcppExamples.bat batch file has options:

========================================================================
   Section III: Building an application using the HDF5 library or DLL
========================================================================

Waring: The instructions below will only describe how to build an application 
        using the release version of the HDF5 library or DLL.  To use the debug
        version of the HDF5 library or DLL, you need to substitute the release 
        version of the HDF5 library or DLL with the debug version.

        
To build an application that uses the HDF5 static library the following 
locations will need to be specified for locating header files and linking with
the HDF static library, for example:

c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\include
c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\lib

We assume that you will use Zlib and Szip compression with HDF5 library.

1. Specifying Include Directories

To specify the include directories in the settings for your Visual Studio 
project, you may choose one of the following two methods.

  Method One: Project-wide Settings

    1. Open your project in Microsoft Visual Studio and make sure it is the 
       active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the "Properties" option.

    3. Choose the build configuration you would like to modify in the drop 
       down menu labeled "Configuration:"

    4. Choose the "C/C++" tab, and select "General".

    5. In a text-area labeled with "Additional Include Directories:", add 
       HDF5, Zlib, and Szip header files directories.  For example:

          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\include
          c:\zlib\include
          c:\szip\include

       Then click OK.

    6. (Optional) To use HDF5 Fortran static library, the location of 
       Fortran module files should be specified by following Project->
       Settings->Fortran->Preprocessor, and in the text-area labeled 
       "Additional Include Directories", add HDF5 Fortran module files 
       directories.  For example:

          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\include
          
  Method Two: Visual Studio Settings

    1. In Visual STudio, go to Tools->Options->Projects->
       VC++ Directories.  Under "Show Directories For", select "Include files"

    2. Insert the correct HDF5, Zlib, Szip paths for headers(include).  For 
       example,

          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\include
          c:\zlib\include
          c:\szip\include

    
2. Specifying Library Directories

To specify the library directories in the settings for your Visual Studio 
project, you may choose one of the following two methods.

  Method One: Project-wide Settings

    1. Open your project in Microsoft Visual Studio and make sure it is the 
       active project.

    2. Go to the Project menu and chose the "Properties" option.

    3. Choose the build configuration you would like to modify in the drop 
       down menu labeled "Configuration:"

    4. Choose the "Linker" tab, and select "General".

    5. In a text-area labeled with "Additional Library Directories:", add 
       HDF5, Zlib, and Szip library files directories.  For example:

          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\lib
          c:\zlib\dll
          c:\szip\dll
          
      Note: To link with HDF5 DLLs rathern that static libraries, simply
            specify the "dll" directory rather than "lib", and link with the
            corresponding DLL link library below.

       Then click OK.

          
  Method Two: Visual Studio Settings

    1. In Visual STudio, go to Tools->Options->Projects->
       VC++ Directories.  Under "Show Directories For", select "Library files"

    2. Insert the correct HDF5, Zlib, Szip paths for link libraries.  For 
       example,

          c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib\release\lib
          c:\zlib\dll
          c:\szip\dll
          
       Note: To link with HDF5 DLLs rathern that static libraries, simply
            specify the "dll" directory rather than "lib", and link with the
            corresponding DLL link library below.

    
3. Specifying Libraries to Link

  To link the HDF5 static library with your application:

    1. In Visual Studio, go to the Project menu and choose "Properties".

    2. Find the "Link" option and "Input" category.  In the "Additional
       Dependencies" field, insert "zlib.lib, libszip.lib, hdf5.lib".

    3. (Optional) Also insert "hdf5_cpp.lib" if you want to use HDF5 C++ 
       static library.

    4. (Optional) Also insert "hdf5_fortran.lib" if you want to use HDF5 
       Fortran static library.

    5. (Optional) Also insert "hdf5_hl.lib" if you want to use HDF5 high 
       level static library.

    6. (Optional) Also insert "hdf5_hl_cpp.lib" if you want to use HDF5 High
       Level C++ static library.

    7. (Optional) Also insert "hdf5_hl_fortran.lib" if you want to use HDF5 
       High Level Fortran static library.


  To link the HDF5 DLL library with your application:

    1. Follow the steps for linking the HDF5 static library as shown above,
       except now link the export library that is created with the DLL.
       
       The export library is called hdf5dll.lib for HDF5 C libray,
       hdf5_cppdll.lib for HDF5 C++ library, and hdf5_fortrandll.lib
       for HDF5 Fortran library.
       
    2. In the Project Properties dialog, go to the C/C++ > Preprocessor
       subsection.  In the "Preprocessor Definitions" box, add "_HDF5USEDLL_"
       to the list.
       
    3. (Optional) Also add HDF5CPP_USEDLL to use HDF5 C++ DLL.

    4. (Optional) Also add _HDF5USEHLDLL_ to use HDF5 high level DLL.

    5. (Optional) Also add HDF5USE_HLCPPDLL use HDF5 high level C++ DLL.

    6. (Optional) Follow Project->Settings->Fortran->Category->General->
       Predefined Preprocess or Symbols, and add "HDF5F90_WINDOWS" to use HDF5 
       Fortran DLL.

    7. Place the DLLs in a location that Windows will be able to locate.  The 
       searched path and order for DLL's is

       a) The directory where the executable module for the current
          process is located.
       b) The current directory.
       c} The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory function
          retrieves the path of this directory.
       d) The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function
          retrieves the path of this directory.
       e) The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

   
========================================================================
            Section IV: How to build HDF5 for 64-bit Windows
========================================================================

HDF5 is available for 64-bit Windows in Visual Studio 2008.  
    
Prerequisites:

    1. A 64-bit Windows machine.
    
    2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 installed with x64 Extensions.
           

Building:

    Building 64-bit Windows binaries is very similar to the process for 32-bit.
    Therefore, you may follow the instructions in Section II with the following
    modifications.
    
        1. The x64 platform must be selected in the build configuration for
           debug and release versions.  Before building, go to "Build", 
           "Configuration Manager".  In the "Active solution platform" box, 
           select "x64", and press "Close".
           
        2. 64-bit HDF5 applications must be built with 64-bit external libraries.
           You must add the include and
           library paths for x64 configurations as you have in the 
           "Prerequisites" section.  This is also true for Intel Fortran if
           Fortran libraries are to be built.       

========================================================================
            Section V: How to build HDF5 applications using Visual Studio 2010
========================================================================
Building with Visual Studio 2010 is very similar to building with Visual Studio
2008, with some minor changes.  Therefore, follow the build instructions above, 
with the following considerations:

    1. Visual Studio 2010 uses a new format for project files, but Visual Studio
       2008 project files can be easily converted.  The HDF5 project files
       will need to be converted on first use.  To do so:
       
       1.1. Open the HDF5 Visual Studio 2008 solution file as in Section II
            (all.sln)
       
       NOTE. Intel Fortran 11.1 currently does not integrate with Visual Studio 2010.
            
       1.2. You will be prompted with an automatic conversion wizard.  Click
            through, accepting the default values.  You may choose to create
            backups of the project files, although it isn't necessary.
            
       1.3. When it is finished, it should state that all projects were
            converted successfully with no errors.  Warnings can be ignored.
            
    2. Once the project files have been converted, build and test normally.
       Note that the converted project files aren't backwards compatible with
       previous versions of Visual Studio.

1. Helpful Pointers

Here are some helpful notes if you are not familiar with
using the Visual C++ Development Environment.

    1.1 Project name and location issues:

    It is recommended that you use the given directory structure for building
    HDF5 Examples.  However, it is possible to create your own structure.  If you must 
    install all.sln and all.vcproj in another directory, relative to hdf5 
    directory, you will be asked to locate the sub-project files, when you open 
    the project all.sln.

    If you want to rename "all" (the entire project), you will need to modify 
    two files all.sln and all.vcproj as text (contrary to the explicit warnings 
    in the files).


    1.2 Settings... details:

    If you create your own project, the necessary settings can be read
    from the all.vcproj file (as text), or from the Project Settings in the
    Visual Studio project settings dialog.

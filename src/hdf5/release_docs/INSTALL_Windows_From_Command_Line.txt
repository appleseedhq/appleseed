*      Instructions for Building and Testing HDF5 on Windows XP        *
*                          (From Command Line)                         *
************************************************************************
Note: This instruction is written for users who would like to build HDF5
      libraries and tools from the HDF5 source code package on command
      line. We no longer support building HDF5 using Microsoft Visual 
    Studio .NET 2003 or Visual Studio VS2005 or Intel Fortran 91.
         
      Currently, we support:
      
      1. Building and testing HDF5 C/C++/Fortran libraries on command line with 
         Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 for 32- or 64-bit Windows.
         
      2. Building and testing HDF5 C/C++/Fortran libraries and utilities using
         CMake tools. Refer to the CMAKE.txt file for detailed information.
      
      For all other Windows development tools, HDF5 should be built in
      the development environment.  Please refer to INSTALL_Windows.txt
      for detailed HDF5 building and installation information, or 
      INSTALL_Windows_Short_VS2008.txt for quick HDF5 building and installation
      instructions.
                        
WARNINGS:

Please read CAREFULLY about HDF5 build and install preconditions and 
notes in INSTALL_Windows.txt before starting below procedures.


========================================================================
   Section I: Building and testing HDF5 on command line with Microsoft 
              Visual Studio
========================================================================
    
1. Preconditions: 

   1.1 Verify environment for Visual Studio
   
   Building from the command line requires environment variables for Visual
   Studio.  These are generally setup when Visual Studio is installed, but you
   can verify by running the command:
        
        echo %vs90comntools%
        
    This should output a path similar to:
    
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9\Common7\Tools\
        
   1.2 Run batch file copy_hdf.bat.

   Go to  c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows and run copy_hdf.bat.
   
   1.3 Setup evironment for external libraries
   
   Similarly to building from within Visual Studio, HDF5 requires environment
   variables for szip and zlib library names.  To define these environment 
   variables:

   From the command prompt that you will be building HDF5 from, issue the
   following command:
   
        set HDF5_EXT_ZLIB=zlib1.lib
        
    replacing "zlib1.lib" with the name of the zlib library on your system.
    Similarly, set HDF5_EXT_SZIP to the name of the szip library on your system.
    
    (Optional) If you will be building using the /useenv switch, you must also
    define variables INCLUDE and LIB with a semi-colon deliminated list of
    paths for szip and zlib include files and libraries, respectively.  Set
    these variables in the same way you set HDF5_EXT_ZLIB and HDF5_EXT_SZIP.

      
2. Building and testing HDF5 libraries and tools

   We provide 2 options for users to build and test HDF5 libraries 
   and tools.
      
    2.1 Options A: Build and test in one step 
      
         A batch file named hdf5bt.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory is 
         provided for users to build and test HDF5 library and tools together 
         from command line.

        hdf5bt file takes the following options:
              /vs9              Build HDF5 using Visual Studio 2008
              /fort             Build and test HDF5 with Fortran libraries
              /ivf101           Build HDF5 Fortran using Intel Visual Fortran 10.1
              /useenv           Build HDF5 using compiler settings defined
                                in the environment, rather than the IDE.
              /?                Help information

            If you specify the "/useenv" option, then include and library
            directories for szip and zlib must have been set in the
            Preconditions above.
            
            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5bt.  Users are 
            encouraged to pipe the test output into a file.  You should find no 
            compilation errors or "*FAILED*" marks.

    2.2 Options B: Build and test in two steps 

         We also provide users with the option to build and test HDF5 libraries 
         and tools seperately.
   
         Step 1) Build HDF5 Libraries and Tools

            A batch file named hdf5build.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 
            directory is provided for users to build HDF5 library and 
            tools from command line.

        hdf5build takes the following options:
              /vs9              Build HDF5 using Visual Studio 2008
              /fort             Build HDF5 with Fortran libraries
              /ivf101           Build HDF5 Fortran using Intel Visual Fortran 10.1
              /nodebug          Build HDF5 release versions only
                                Note: Default is to build debug and release versions
              /useenv           Build HDF5 using compiler settings defined
                                in the environment, rather than the IDE.
              /?                Help information
            
            If you specify the "/useenv" option, then include and library
            directories for szip and zlib must have been set in the
            Preconditions above.
            
            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5build.  Users are 
            encouraged to pipe the test output into a file.  You can check 
            the file to find out whether there are any compilation errors.

         Step 2) Test HDF5 Libraries and Tools
   
            HDF5 comes with various test suites, all of which can be tested with 
            hdf5check.bat batch file in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5 directory.

            hdf5check batch file can be run with one of the following four options:

              hdf5check                  Test HDF5 C library and tools only.

              hdf5check enablecpp        Test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools.

              hdf5check enablefortran    Test HDF5 C/Fortran libraries and 
                                         tools.  To use this option, HDF5 
                                         Fortran libraries must have been built.

              hdf5check enableall        Test HDF5 C/Fortran libraries and 
                                         tools.  To use this option, HDF5 
                                         Fortran libraries must have been built.

        nodebug option can be added to any of the above options to only
        test the release versions.
        
            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate 
            option.  Users are encouraged to pipe the test output into a file.  
            You should find no "*FAILED*" marks.

3. Installing HDF5 Libraries

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install all
HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.

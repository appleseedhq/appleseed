*****************************************************************************

1. Obtaining HDF5
        The latest supported public release of HDF5 is available from
        ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/current/src.  For Unix and UNIX-like 
        platforms, it is available in tar format compressed with gzip.  
        For Microsoft Windows, it is in ZIP format.

        The HDF team also makes snapshots of the source code available on
        a regular basis. These snapshots are unsupported (that is, the
        HDF team will not release a bug-fix on a particular snapshot;
        rather any bug fixes will be rolled into the next snapshot).
        Furthermore, the snapshots have only been tested on a few
        machines and may not test correctly for parallel applications.
        Snapshots, in a limited number of formats, can be found on The
        HDF Group's development FTP server:

            ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/pub/outgoing/hdf5/snapshots 


2. Quick installation
        For those who don't like to read ;-) the following steps can be used
        to configure, build, test, and install the HDF5 Library, header files,
        and support programs. For example, to install HDF5 version X.Y.Z at
        location /usr/local/hdf5, use the following steps.

            $ gunzip < hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.gz | tar xf -
            $ cd hdf5-X.Y.Z
            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 <more configure_flags>
            $ make
            $ make check                # run test suite.
            $ make install
            $ make check-install        # verify installation.

        Some versions of the tar command support the -z option. In such cases,
        the first step above can be simplified to the following:

            $ tar zxf hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

        <configure_flags> above refers to the configure flags appropriate
        to your installation.  For example, to install HDF5 with the 
        Fortran and C++ interfaces and with SZIP compression, the 
        configure line might read as follows:
        
            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 --enable-fortran \
                          --enable-cxx --with-szlib=PATH_TO_SZIP

        In this case, PATH_TO_SZIP would be replaced with the path to the 
        installed location of the SZIP library.

2.1. Windows
        Users of Microsoft Windows should see the INSTALL_Windows files for
        detailed instructions.

2.2. RedStorm (Cray XT3)
        Users of the Red Storm machine, after reading this file, should read
        the Red Storm section in the INSTALL_parallel file for specific
        instructions for the Red Storm machine.  The same instructions would
        probably work for other Cray XT3 systems, but they have not been
        verified.


3. HDF5 dependencies
3.1. Zlib
        The HDF5 Library includes a predefined compression filter that 
        uses the "deflate" method for chunked datasets. If zlib-1.1.2 or
        later is found, HDF5 will use it.  Otherwise, HDF5's predefined
        compression method will degenerate to a no-op; the compression
        filter will succeed but the data will not be compressed.

3.2. Szip (optional)
        The HDF5 Library includes a predefined compression filter that 
        uses the extended-Rice lossless compression algorithm for chunked 
        datasets. For more information about Szip compression and license 
        terms, see http://hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/.

        Precompiled Szip binaries for each supported platform and a source 
        tar file can be found at ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/.
        
        To configure the HDF5 Library with the Szip compression filter, use 
        the '--with-szlib=/PATH_TO_SZIP' flag. For more information, see 
        section 4.3.7, "Specifying other libraries and headers."

        Starting with release 1.6.3, Szip library binaries are distributed 
        with the encoder enabled (a license may be required to use this binary) 
        and with the encoder disabled (freely usable without a license). 
        If the encoder enabled binary is used, Szip compression encoding is 
        available for an HDF5 application; if the encoder disabled binary is 
        used, Szip compression is not available.  Szip decoding is always 
        available for applications (i.e., an HDF5 application can always read 
        Szip-compressed data) if the Szip filter is present, regardless of the 
        binary used.

3.3. MPI and MPI-IO
        The parallel version of the library is built upon the foundation
        provided by MPI and MPI-IO. If these libraries are not available
        when HDF5 is configured, only a serial version of HDF5 can be built.


4. Full installation instructions for source distributions

4.1. Unpacking the distribution
        The HDF5 source code is distributed in a variety of formats which
        can be unpacked with the following commands, each of which creates an
        'hdf5-X.Y.Z' directory, where X.Y.Z is the HDF5 version numbers.

4.1.1. Non-compressed tar archive (*.tar)

            $ tar xf hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar

4.1.2. Compressed tar archive (*.tar.Z)

            $ uncompress -c < hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.Z | tar xf -
            Or
            $ tar Zxf hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.Z

4.1.3. Gzip'd tar archive (*.tar.gz)

            $ gunzip < hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.gz | tar xf -
            Or
            $ tar zxf hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

4.1.4. Bzip'd tar archive (*.tar.bz2)

            $ bunzip2 < hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
            Or
            $ tar jxf hdf5-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2

4.2. Source versus build directories
        On most systems the build can occur in a directory other than the
        source directory, allowing multiple concurrent builds and/or
        read-only source code. In order to accomplish this, one should
        create a build directory, cd into that directory, and run the
        `configure' script found in the source directory (configure
        details are below). For example,
            $ mkdir built-fortran
            $ cd build-fortran
            $ ../hdf5-X.Y.Z/configure --enable-fortran ...

        Unfortunately, this does not work on recent Irix platforms (6.5?
        and later) because that `make' does not understand the VPATH variable. 
        However, HDF5 also supports Irix `pmake' which has a .PATH target 
        which serves a similar purpose. Here's what the Irix man pages say 
        about VPATH, the facility used by HDF5 makefiles for this feature:

                The VPATH facility is a derivation of the undocumented
                VPATH feature in the System V Release 3 version of make.
                System V Release 4 has a new VPATH implementation, much
                like the pmake(1) .PATH feature. This new feature is also
                undocumented in the standard System V Release 4 manual
                pages.  For this reason it is not available in the IRIX
                version of make. The VPATH facility should not be used
                with the new parallel make option.

4.3. Configuring
        HDF5 uses the GNU autoconf system for configuration, which
        detects various features of the host system and creates the
        Makefiles. On most systems it should be sufficient to say:

            $ ./configure        
            Or
            $ sh configure

        The configuration process can be controlled through environment
        variables, command-line switches, and host configuration files.
        For a complete list of switches type:

            $ ./configure --help

        The host configuration files are located in the `config'
        directory and are based on architecture name, vendor name, and/or
        operating system which are displayed near the beginning of the
        `configure' output. The host config file influences the behavior
        of configure by setting or augmenting shell variables.

4.3.1. Specifying the installation directories
        The default installation location is the HDF5 directory created in
        the build directory. Typing `make install' will install the HDF5
        Library, header files, examples, and support programs in hdf5/lib,
        hdf5/include, hdf5/doc/hdf5/examples, and hdf5/bin. To use a path
        other than hdf5, specify the path with the `--prefix=PATH' switch:

            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

        If shared libraries are being built (the default), the final
        home of the shared library must be specified with this switch
        before the library and executables are built.

        HDF5 can be installed into a different location than the prefix
        specified at configure time; see section 4.6, "Installing HDF5," 
        for more details.

4.3.2. Using an alternate C compiler
        By default, configure will look for the C compiler by trying
        `gcc' and `cc'. However, if the environment variable "CC" is set
        then its value is used as the C compiler.  For instance, one would 
        use the following line to specify the native C compiler on a system 
        that also has the GNU gcc compiler (users of csh and derivatives 
        will need to prefix the commands below with `env'):

            $ CC=cc ./configure

        A parallel version of HDF5 can be built by specifying `mpicc'
        as the C compiler.  (The `--enable-parallel' flag documented
        below is optional in this case.)  Using the `mpicc' compiler
        will insure that the correct MPI and MPI-IO header files and
        libraries are used.

            $ CC=/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpicc ./configure

4.3.3. Configuring for 64-bit support
        Several machine architectures support 32-bit or 64-bit binaries.
        The options below describe how to enable support for different options.

        On Irix64, the default compiler is `cc'. To use an alternate compiler,
        specify it with the CC variable:

            $ CC='cc -n32' ./configure

        Similarly, users compiling on a Solaris machine and desiring to
        build the distribution with 64-bit support should specify the
        correct flags with the CC variable:

            $ CC='cc -m64' ./configure

        To configure AIX 64-bit support including the Fortran and C++ APIs,
        (Note: need to set $AR to 'ar -X 64'.)
        Serial:
            $ CFLAGS=-q64 FFLAGS=-q64 CXXFLAGS=-q64 AR='ar -X 64'\
              ./configure --enable-fortran
        Parallel: (C++ not supported with parallel)
            $ CFLAGS=-q64 FFLAGS=-q64 AR='ar -X 64'\
              ./configure --enable-fortran

4.3.4. Additional compilation flags
        If addtional flags must be passed to the compilation commands,
        specify those flags with the CFLAGS variable. For instance,
        to enable symbolic debugging of a production version of HDF5, one
        might say:

            $ CFLAGS=-g ./configure --enable-production

4.3.5. Compiling HDF5 wrapper libraries
        One can optionally build the Fortran and/or C++ interfaces to the
        HDF5 C library. By default, both options are disabled. To build
        them, specify `--enable-fortran' and `--enable-cxx', respectively.

            $ ./configure --enable-fortran
            $ ./configure --enable-cxx
        
        Configuration will halt if a working Fortran 90 or 95 compiler or
        C++ compiler is not found. Currently, the Fortran configure tests
        for these compilers in order: f90, pgf90, f95. To use an
        alternate compiler specify it with the FC variable:

            $ FC=/usr/local/bin/g95 ./configure --enable-fortran

        Note: The Fortran and C++ interfaces are not supported on all the
              platforms the main HDF5 Library supports. Also, the Fortran
              interface supports parallel HDF5 while the C++ interface does
              not.

        Note: See sections 4.7 and 4.8 for building the Fortran library with
              Intel or PGI compilers. 

4.3.6. Specifying other programs
        The build system has been tuned for use with GNU make but also 
        works with other versions of make.  If the `make' command runs a
        non-GNU version but a GNU version is available under a different
        name (perhaps `gmake'), then HDF5 can be configured to use it by
        setting the MAKE variable. Note that whatever value is used for
        MAKE must also be used as the make command when building the
        library:

            $ MAKE=gmake ./configure
            $ gmake

        The `AR' and `RANLIB' variables can also be set to the names of
        the `ar' and `ranlib' (or `:') commands to override values
        detected by configure.

        The HDF5 Library, include files, and utilities are installed
        during `make install' (described below) with a BSD-compatible
        install program detected automatically by configure. If none is
        found, the shell script bin/install-sh is used. Configure does not
        check that the install script actually works; if a bad install is 
        detected on your system (e.g., on the ASCI blue machine as of 
        March 2, 1999) you have two choices:

            1. Copy the bin/install-sh program to your $HOME/bin
               directory, name it `install', and make sure that $HOME/bin
               is searched before the system bin directories.

            2. Specify the full path name of the `install-sh' program
               as the value of the INSTALL environment variable. Note: do
               not use `cp' or some other program in place of install
               because the HDF5 makefiles also use the install program to
               change file ownership and/or access permissions.

4.3.7. Specifying other libraries and headers
        Configure searches the standard places (those places known by the
        systems compiler) for include files and header files. However,
        additional directories can be specified by using the CPPFLAGS
        and/or LDFLAGS variables:

            $ CPPFLAGS=-I/home/robb/include \
              LDFLAGS=-L/home/robb/lib \
              ./configure

        HDF5 uses the zlib library to support the HDF5 deflate 
        data compression filter.  Configure searches the standard places 
        (plus those specified above with the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables) 
        for the zlib headers and library. The search can be disabled by 
        specifying `--without-zlib' or alternate directories can be specified 
        with `--with-zlib=INCDIR,LIBDIR' or through the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
        variables:

            $ ./configure --with-zlib=/usr/unsup/include,/usr/unsup/lib

            $ CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/unsup/include \
              LDFLAGS=-L/usr/unsup/lib \
              ./configure

        HDF5 includes Szip as a predefined compression method (see 3.2).  
        To enable Szip compression, the HDF5 Library must be configured 
        and built using the Szip Library:

            $ ./configure --with-szlib=/Szip_Install_Directory

4.3.8. Static versus shared linking
        The build process will create static libraries on all systems and
        shared libraries on systems that support dynamic linking to a
        sufficient degree. Either form of the library may be suppressed by
        saying `--disable-static' or `--disable-shared'.

            $ ./configure --disable-shared

        Shared C++ and Fortran libraries will be built if shared libraries
        are enabled.

        To build only statically linked executables on platforms which
        support shared libraries, use the `--enable-static-exec' flag.

            $ ./configure --enable-static-exec

4.3.9. Optimization versus symbolic debugging
        The library can be compiled to provide symbolic debugging support
        so it can be debugged with gdb, dbx, ddd, etc., or it can be
        compiled with various optimizations. To compile for symbolic
        debugging (the default for snapshots), say `--disable-production';
        to compile with optimizations (the default for supported public
        releases), say `--enable-production'. On some systems the library
        can also be compiled for profiling with gprof by saying
        `--enable-production=profile'.

            $ ./configure --disable-production         #symbolic debugging
            $ ./configure --enable-production          #optimized code
            $ ./configure --enable-production=profile  #for use with gprof

        Regardless of whether support for symbolic debugging is enabled,
        the library can also perform runtime debugging of certain packages 
        (such as type conversion execution times and extensive invariant 
        condition checking). To enable this debugging, supply a
        comma-separated list of package names to to the `--enable-debug'
        switch.  See "Debugging HDF5 Applications" for a list of package 
        names:

            http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.user/Debugging.html

        Debugging can be disabled by saying `--disable-debug'. 
        The default debugging level for snapshots is a subset of the
        available packages; the default for supported releases is no
        debugging (debugging can incur a significant runtime penalty).

            $ ./configure --enable-debug=s,t  #debug only H5S and H5T
            $ ./configure --enable-debug      #debug normal packages
            $ ./configure --enable-debug=all  #debug all packages
            $ ./configure --disable-debug     #no debugging

        HDF5 can also print a trace of all API function calls, their 
        arguments, and the return values. To enable or disable the
        ability to trace the API say `--enable-trace' (the default for
        snapthots) or `--disable-trace' (the default for public releases). 
        The tracing must also be enabled at runtime to see any output 
        (see "Debugging HDF5 Applications," reference above).

4.3.10. Parallel versus serial library
        The HDF5 Library can be configured to use MPI and MPI-IO for
        parallelism on a distributed multi-processor system.  Read the
        file INSTALL_parallel for detailed explanations.

4.3.11. Threadsafe capability
        The HDF5 Library can be configured to be thread-safe (on a very
        large scale) with the `--enable-threadsafe' flag to the configure
        script.  Some platforms may also require the '-with-pthread=INC,LIB'
        (or '--with-pthread=DIR') flag to the configure script.
        For further details, see "HDF5 Thread Safe Library":

            http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/TechNotes/ThreadSafeLibrary.html

4.3.12. Backward compatibility
        The 1.8 version of the HDF5 Library can be configured to operate
        identically to the v1.6 library with the 
            --with-default-api-version=v16
        configure flag. This allows existing code to be compiled with the
        v1.8 library without requiring immediate changes to the application 
        source code.  For addtional configuration options and other details, 
        see "API Compatibility Macros in HDF5":

            http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/APICompatMacros.html 

4.4. Building
        The library, confidence tests, and programs can be built by
        saying just:

            $ make

        Note that if you have supplied some other make command via the MAKE
        variable during the configuration step, that same command must be
        used here.

        When using GNU make, you can add `-j -l6' to the make command to
        compile in parallel on SMP machines. Do not give a number after
        the `-j' since GNU make will turn it off for recursive invocations
        of make.

            $ make -j -l6

4.5. Testing
        HDF5 comes with various test suites, all of which can be run by
        saying

            $ make check

        To run only the tests for the library, change to the `test'
        directory before issuing the command. Similarly, tests for the
        parallel aspects of the library are in `testpar' and tests for
        the support programs are in `tools'.

        The `check' consists of two sub-tests, check-s and check-p, which
        are for serial and parallel tests, respectively.  Since serial tests
        and parallel tests must be run with single and multiple processes
        respectively, the two sub-tests work nicely for batch systems in
        which the number of processes is fixed per batch job.  One may submit
        one batch job, requesting 1 process, to run all the serial tests by
        "make check-s"; and submit another batch job, requesting multiple
        processes, to run all the parallel tests by "make check-p".

        Temporary files will be deleted by each test when it completes,
        but may continue to exist in an incomplete state if the test
        fails. To prevent deletion of the files, define the HDF5_NOCLEANUP
        environment variable.

        The HDF5 tests can take a long time to run on some systems.  To perform
        a faster (but less thorough) test, set the HDF5TestExpress environment
        variable to 2 or 3 (with 3 being the shortest run).  To perform a
        longer test, set HDF5TestExpress to 0.  1 is the default.

4.6. Installing HDF5
        The HDF5 Library, include files, and support programs can be
        installed in a (semi-)public place by saying `make install'. The
        files are installed under the directory specified with
        `--prefix=DIR' (default is 'hdf5') in directories named `lib',
        `include', and `bin'. The directories, if not existing, will be
        created automatically, provided the mkdir command supports the -p
        option.

        If `make install' fails because the install command at your site
        somehow fails, you may use the install-sh that comes with the
        source. You will need to run ./configure again.

            $ INSTALL="$PWD/bin/install-sh -c" ./configure ...
            $ make install

        If you want to install HDF5 in a location other than the location
        specified by the `--prefix=DIR' flag during configuration (or
        instead of the default location, `hdf5'), you can do that
        by running the deploy script:

            $ bin/deploy NEW_DIR

        This will install HDF5 in NEW_DIR.  Alternately, you can do this
        manually by issuing the command:

            $ make install prefix=NEW_DIR

        where NEW_DIR is the new directory where you wish to install HDF5. 
        If you do not use the deploy script, you should run h5redeploy in
        NEW_DIR/bin directory.  This utility will fix the h5cc, h5fc and
        h5c++ scripts to reflect the new NEW_DIR location.

        The library can be used without installing it by pointing the
        compiler at the `src' and 'src/.libs' directory for include files and
        libraries. However, the minimum which must be installed to make
        the library publicly available is:

            The library:
                ./src/.libs/libhdf5.a

            The public header files:
                ./src/H5*public.h, ./src/H5public.h
                ./src/H5FD*.h except ./src/H5FDprivate.h,
                ./src/H5api_adpt.h

            The main header file:
                ./src/hdf5.h

            The configuration information:
                ./src/H5pubconf.h
        
            The support programs that are useful are:
            ./tools/h5ls/h5ls               (list file contents)
            ./tools/h5dump/h5dump           (dump file contents)
            ./tools/misc/h5repart           (repartition file families)
            ./tools/misc/h5debug            (low-level file debugging)
            ./tools/h5import/h5import       (imports data to HDF5 file)
            ./tools/h5diff/h5diff           (compares two HDF5 files)
            ./tools/gifconv/h52gif          (HDF5 to GIF converter) 
            ./tools/gifconv/gif2h5          (GIF to HDF5 converter)


5. Using the Library
        Please see the "HDF5 User's Guide" and the "HDF5 Reference Manual":

            http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/

        Most programs will include <hdf5.h> and link with -lhdf5.
        Additional libraries may also be necessary depending on whether
        support for compression, etc., was compiled into the HDF5 Library.

        A summary of the HDF5 installation can be found in the
        libhdf5.settings file in the same directory as the static and/or
        shared HDF5 Libraries.


6. Support
        Support is described in the README file.


*****************************************************************************
			    APPENDIX
*****************************************************************************

A. Warnings about compilers
        Output from the following compilers should be extremely suspected
        when used to compile the HDF5 Library, especially if optimizations are
        enabled. In all cases, HDF5 attempts to work around the compiler bugs.

A.1. GNU (Intel platforms)
        Versions before 2.8.1 have serious problems allocating registers
        when functions contain operations on `long long' datatypes.

A.2. COMPAQ/DEC
        The V5.2-038 compiler (and possibly others) occasionally
        generates incorrect code for memcpy() calls when optimizations
        are enabled, resulting in unaligned access faults. HDF5 works
        around the problem by casting the second argument to `char *'.
        The Fortran module (5.4.1a) fails in compiling some Fortran
        programs.  Use 5.5.0 or higher.

A.3. SGI (Irix64 6.2)
        The Mongoose 7.00 compiler has serious optimization bugs and
        should be upgraded to MIPSpro 7.2.1.2m. Patches are available
        from SGI.

A.4. Windows/NT
        The Microsoft Win32 5.0 compiler is unable to cast unsigned long
        long values to doubles. HDF5 works around this bug by first
        casting to signed long long and then to double.

        A link warning: defaultlib "LIBC" conflicts with use of other libs
        appears for debug version of VC++ 6.0. This warning will not affect
        building and testing HDF5 Libraries. 


B. Large (>2GB) versus small (<2GB) file capability
        In order to read or write files that could potentially be larger
        than 2GB, it is necessary to use the non-ANSI `long long' data
        type on some platforms. However, some compilers (e.g., GNU gcc
        versions before 2.8.1 on Intel platforms) are unable to produce
        correct machine code for this datatype. 


C. Building and testing with other compilers
C.1.  Building and testing with Intel compilers
        When Intel compilers are used (icc or ecc), you will need to modify
        the generated "libtool" program after configuration is finished.
        On or around line 104 of the libtool file, there are lines which 
        look like:

            # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
            wl=""

        Change these lines to this:

            # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
            wl="-Wl,"

        UPDATE: This is now done automatically by the configure script. 
        However, if you still experience a problem, you may want to check this 
        line in the libtool file and make sure that it has the correct value.

      * To build the Fortran library using Intel compiler on Linux 2.4, 
        one has to perform the following steps:
          x Use the -fpp -DDEC$=DEC_ -DMS$=MS_ compiler flags to disable
            DEC and MS compiler directives in source files in the fortran/src, 
            fortran/test, and fortran/examples directories.
            E.g.,  setenv F9X 'ifc -fpp -DDEC$=DEC_ -DMS$=MS_'
            Do not use double quotes since $ is interpreted in them.

          x If Version 6.0 of Fortran compiler is used, the build fails in 
            the fortran/test directory and then in the fortran/examples 
            directory.  To proceed, edit the work.pcl files in those 
            directories to contain two lines:

                    work.pc
                    ../src/work.pc 

          x Do the same in the fortran/examples directory.

          x A problem with work.pc files was resolved for the newest version 
            of the compiler (7.0).

       * To build the Fortran library on IA32, follow the steps described 
         above, except that the DEC and MS compiler directives should be 
         removed manually or use a patch from HDF FTP server:

             ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/current/


C.2.  Building and testing with PGI compilers
        When PGI C and C++ compilers are used (pgcc or pgCC), you will need to 
        modify the generated "libtool" program after configuration is finished.
        On or around line 104 of the libtool file, there are lines which 
        look like this:

            # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
            wl=""

        Change these lines to this:

            # How to pass a linker flag through the compiler.
            wl="-Wl,"

        UPDATE: This is now done automatically by the configure script. However,
        if you still experience a problem, you may want to check this line in
        the libtool file and make sure that it has the correct value.

        To build the HDF5 C++ Library with pgCC (version 4.0 and later), set
        the environment variable CXX to "pgCC -tlocal"
            setenv CXX "pgCC -tlocal"
        before running the configure script.

# This script will compile and run the fortran examples from source files       #
# installed in .../share/hdf5_examples/hl/fortran using h5fc or h5pfc.  The     #
# order for running programs with RunTest in the MAIN section below is taken    #
# from the Makefile.  The order is important since some of the test programs    #
# use data files created by earlier test programs.  Any future additions should #
# be placed accordingly.                                                        #

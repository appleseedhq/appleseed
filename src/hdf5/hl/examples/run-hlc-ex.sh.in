# This script will compile and run the c examples from source files installed   #
# in .../share/hdf5_examples/hl/c using h5cc or h5pc.  The order for running    #
# programs with RunTest in the MAIN section below is taken from the Makefile.   #
# The order is important since some of the test programs use data files created #
# by earlier test programs.  Any future additions should be placed accordingly. #
#                                                                               #

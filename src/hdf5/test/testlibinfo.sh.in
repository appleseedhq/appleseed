# Tests for the embedded library information feature.
# Part 1:
# Verify the HDF5 library does contains an exact copy of the content of the
# libhdf5.settings file.
# Part 2:
# If executable is linked with the static hdf5 library (how to determine?),
# verify an executable indeed contains an exact copy of hte content of the
# libhdf5.settings file.

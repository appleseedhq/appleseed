#
# A variant of the QT4_WRAP_CPP macro designed to moc .cpp files.
#
# It differs from the original macro in two ways:
#
#   1.  It generates a file of the form moc_cpp_XXX.cxx for a given input file XXX.cpp,
#       whereas the original macro generates a file of the form moc_XXX.cxx for a given
#       input file XXX.h.
#
#   2.  It adds a dependency between the input file XXX.cpp and the generated file so
#       that the generated file gets rebuilt whenever the input file is modified. This
#       is necessary because the generated file is to be included in the input file.
#
# The original QT4_WRAP_CPP macro can be found in share/cmake-2.8/Modules/Qt4Macros.cmake.

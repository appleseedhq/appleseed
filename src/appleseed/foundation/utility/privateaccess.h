// ------- Framework -------
// The little library required to work this magic

// Generate a static data member of type Tag::type in which to store
// the address of a private member.  It is crucial that Tag does not
// depend on the /value/ of the the stored address in any way so that
// we can access it from ordinary code without directly touching
// private data.
template <typename Tag>
struct Stowed
{
    static typename Tag::type value;
};

template <typename Tag>
typename Tag::type Stowed<Tag>::value;

// Generate a static data member whose constructor initializes
// Stowed<Tag>::value.  This type will only be named in an explicit
// instantiation, where it is legal to pass the address of a private
// member.
template <typename Tag, typename Tag::type x>
struct StowPrivate
{
    StowPrivate() { Stowed<Tag>::value = x;}
    static StowPrivate instance;

// A demonstration of how to use the library, with explanation

<p>
      The intent of this library is to implement the unordered containers in the
      draft standard, so the interface was fixed. But there are still some implementation
      decisions to make. The priorities are conformance to the standard and portability.
    </p>
<p>
      The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table" target="_top">wikipedia article
      on hash tables</a> has a good summary of the implementation issues for
      hash tables in general.
    </p>
<a name="unordered.rationale.data_structure"></a><h3>
<a name="id3946912"></a>
      <a class="link" href="rationale.html#unordered.rationale.data_structure">Data Structure</a>
    </h3>
<p>
      By specifying an interface for accessing the buckets of the container the standard
      pretty much requires that the hash table uses chained addressing.
    </p>
<p>
      It would be conceivable to write a hash table that uses another method. For
      example, it could use open addressing, and use the lookup chain to act as a
      bucket but there are a some serious problems with this:
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
        The draft standard requires that pointers to elements aren't invalidated,
        so the elements can't be stored in one array, but will need a layer of indirection
        instead - losing the efficiency and most of the memory gain, the main advantages
        of open addressing.
      </li>
<li>
        Local iterators would be very inefficient and may not be able to meet the
        complexity requirements.
      </li>
<li>
        There are also the restrictions on when iterators can be invalidated. Since
        open addressing degrades badly when there are a high number of collisions
        the restrictions could prevent a rehash when it's really needed. The maximum
        load factor could be set to a fairly low value to work around this - but
        the standard requires that it is initially set to 1.0.
      </li>
<li>
        And since the standard is written with a eye towards chained addressing,
        users will be surprised if the performance doesn't reflect that.
      </li>
</ul></div>
<p>
      So chained addressing is used.
    </p>
<p>
      For containers with unique keys I store the buckets in a single-linked list.
      There are other possible data structures (such as a double-linked list) that
      allow for some operations to be faster (such as erasing and iteration) but
      the possible gain seems small compared to the extra memory needed. The most
      commonly used operations (insertion and lookup) would not be improved at all.
    </p>
<p>
      But for containers with equivalent keys a single-linked list can degrade badly
      when a large number of elements with equivalent keys are inserted. I think
      it's reasonable to assume that users who choose to use <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">unordered_multiset</span></code>
      or <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">unordered_multimap</span></code> do so
      because they are likely to insert elements with equivalent keys. So I have
      used an alternative data structure that doesn't degrade, at the expense of
      an extra pointer per node.
    </p>
<p>
      This works by adding storing a circular linked list for each group of equivalent
      nodes in reverse order. This allows quick navigation to the end of a group
      (since the first element points to the last) and can be quickly updated when
      elements are inserted or erased. The main disadvantage of this approach is
      some hairy code for erasing elements.

<a name="id3947032"></a>
      <a class="link" href="rationale.html#unordered.rationale.number_of_buckets">Number of Buckets</a>
    </h3>
<p>
      There are two popular methods for choosing the number of buckets in a hash
      table. One is to have a prime number of buckets, another is to use a power
      of 2.
    </p>
<p>
      Using a prime number of buckets, and choosing a bucket by using the modulus
      of the hash function's result will usually give a good result. The downside
      is that the required modulus operation is fairly expensive.
    </p>
<p>
      Using a power of 2 allows for much quicker selection of the bucket to use,
      but at the expense of loosing the upper bits of the hash value. For some specially
      designed hash functions it is possible to do this and still get a good result
      but as the containers can take arbitrary hash functions this can't be relied
      on.
    </p>
<p>
      To avoid this a transformation could be applied to the hash function, for an
      example see <a href="http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/inthash.htm" target="_top">Thomas
      Wang's article on integer hash functions</a>. Unfortunately, a transformation
      like Wang's requires knowledge of the number of bits in the hash value, so
      it isn't portable enough. This leaves more expensive methods, such as Knuth's
      Multiplicative Method (mentioned in Wang's article). These don't tend to work
      as well as taking the modulus of a prime, and the extra computation required
      might negate efficiency advantage of power of 2 hash tables.
    </p>
<p>
      So, this implementation uses a prime number for the hash table size.

      the committee have now decided that <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">swap</span></code>
      should do a fast swap if the allocator is Swappable and a slow swap using copy
      construction otherwise. To make this distinction requires concepts.

      Omnibus Allocator Fix-up Proposals</a>, Pablo Halpern suggests that there
      are actually two distinct allocator models, "Moves with Value" and
      "Scoped" which behave differently:
    </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
        </p>
<p>
          When allocators are allowed to have state, it is necessary to have a model
          for determining from where an object obtains its allocator. We&#8217;ve identified
          two such models: the &#8220;Moves with Value&#8221; allocator model and the &#8220;Scoped&#8221;
          allocator model.
        </p>
<p>
        </p>
<p>
          In the &#8220;Moves with Value&#8221; allocator model, the copy constructor of
          an allocator-aware class will copy both the value and the allocator from
          its argument. This is the model specified in the C++03 standard. With this
          model, inserting an object into a container usually causes the new container
          item to copy the allocator from the object that was inserted. This model
          can be useful in special circumstances, e.g., if the items within a container
          use an allocator that is specially tuned to the item&#8217;s type.
        </p>
<p>
        </p>
<p>
          In the &#8220;Scoped&#8221; allocator model, the allocator used to construct an
          object is determined by the context of that object, much like a storage
          class. With this model, inserting an object into a container causes the
          new container item to use the same allocator as the container. To avoid
          allocators being used in the wrong context, the allocator is never copied
          during copy or move construction. Thus, it is possible using this model
          to use allocators based on short-lived resources without fear that an object
          will transfer its allocator to a copy that might outlive the (shared) allocator
          resource. This model is reasonably safe and generally useful on a large
          scale. There was strong support in the 2005 Tremblant meeting for pursuing
          an allocator model that propagates allocators from container to contained
          objects.
        </p>
<p>
      </p>
</blockquote></div>
<p>
      With these models the choice becomes clearer:
    </p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
        </p>
<p>
          I introduced the &#8220;Moves with Value&#8221; allocator model and the &#8220;Scoped&#8221;
          allocator model. In the former case, the allocator is copied when the container
          is copy-constructed. In the latter case it is not. Swapping the allocators
          is the right thing to do if the containers conform to the &#8220;Moves with
          Value&#8221; allocator model and absolutely the wrong thing to do if the containers
          conform to the &#8220;Scoped&#8221; allocator model. With the two allocator models
          well-defined, the desired behavior becomes clear.
        </p>
<p>
      </p>
</blockquote></div>
<p>
      The proposal is that allocators are swapped if the allocator follows the "Moves
      with Value" model and the allocator is swappable. Otherwise a slow swap
      is used. Since containers currently only support the "Moves with Value"
      model this is consistent with the committee's current recommendation (although
      it suggests using a trait to detect if the allocator is swappable rather than
      a concept).
    </p>
<p>
      Since there is currently neither have a swappable trait or concept for allocators
      this implementation always performs a slow swap.

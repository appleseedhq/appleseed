<h2><a name="rationale"></a>Rationale</h2>
                  
<p>Constructing and initializing objects in a generic way is difficult in
    C++. The problem is that there are several different rules that apply
for    initialization. Depending on the type, the value of a newly constructed
  object  can be zero-initialized (logically 0), default-constructed (using
  the default constructor), or indeterminate. When writing generic code,
this  problem must be addressed. The template <code>value_initialized</code> provides
a solution   with consistent syntax for value   initialization of scalar,
union and class   types.
Moreover, <code>value_initialized</code> offers a workaround to various
compiler issues regarding value-initialization.

Furthermore, a <code>const</code> object, <code>initialized_value</code> is provided,
to avoid repeating the type name when retrieving the value from a
<code>value_initialized&lt;T&gt;</code> object.
<br>
  </p>
        
<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
     
<p>
There are various ways to initialize a variable, in C++. The following
declarations all <em>may</em> have a local variable initialized to its default
value:
<pre>
  T1 var1;
  T2 var2 = 0;
  T3 var3 = {};
  T4 var4 = T4();
</pre> 
Unfortunately, whether or not any of those declarations correctly
initialize the variable very much depends on its type. The first
declaration is valid for any <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/DefaultConstructible.html">
DefaultConstructible</a> type (by definition).
However, it does not always do an initialization!
It correctly initializes the variable when it's an instance of a
class, and the author of the class has provided a proper default
constructor. On the other hand, the value of <code>var1</code> is <em>indeterminate</em> when
its type is an arithmetic type, like <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, or <code>char</code>.
An arithmetic variable
is of course initialized properly by the second declaration, <code>T2
var2 = 0</code>. But this initialization form usually won't work for a
class type (unless the class was especially written to support being
initialized that way). The third form,  <code>T3 var3 = {}</code>
initializes an aggregate, typically a "C-style" <code>struct</code> or a "C-style" array.
However, the syntax is not allowed for a class that has an explicitly declared
constructor.  (But watch out for an upcoming C++ language change, 
by Bjarne Stroustrup et al [<a href="#references">1</a>]!)
The fourth form is the most generic form of them, as it
can be used to initialize arithmetic types, class types, aggregates, pointers, and
other types. The declaration,  <code>T4 var4 = T4()</code>, should be read
as follows: First a temporary object is created, by <code>T4()</code>.
This object is <a href="#valueinit">value-initialized</a>. Next the temporary
object is copied to the named variable, <code>var4</code>. Afterwards, the temporary
is destroyed. While the copying and the destruction are likely to
be optimized away, C++ still requires the type <code>T4</code> to be
<a href="CopyConstructible.html">CopyConstructible</a>.
(So <code>T4</code> needs to be <em>both</em> DefaultConstructible <em>and</em> CopyConstructible.) 
A class may not be CopyConstructible, for example because it may have a
private and undefined copy constructor,
or because it may be derived from <a href="utility.htm#Class_noncopyable">boost::noncopyable</a>.
Scott Meyers [<a href="#references">2</a>] explains why a class would be defined like that.
</p>
<p>
There is another, less obvious disadvantage to the fourth form, <code>T4 var4 = T4()</code>:
It suffers from various  <a href="#compiler_issues">compiler issues</a>, causing
a variable to be left uninitialized in some compiler specific cases.
</p>
<p>
The template <a href="#val_init"><code>value_initialized</code></a>
offers a generic way to initialize
an object, like <code>T4 var4 = T4()</code>, but without requiring its type
to be CopyConstructible. And it offers a workaround to those compiler issues
regarding value-initialization as well! It allows getting an initialized
variable of any type; it <em>only</em> requires the type to be DefaultConstructible.
A properly <em>value-initialized</em> object of type <code>T</code> is
constructed by the following declaration:
<pre>
  value_initialized&lt;T&gt; var;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The <code>const</code> object <a href="#initialized_value"><code>initialized_value</code></a>
allows value-initializing a variable as follows:
<pre>
  T var = initialized_value ;
</pre>
This form of initialization is semantically equivalent to <code>T4 var4 = T4()</code>,
but robust against the aforementioned compiler issues.

</p>

<h2><a name="details"></a>Details</h2>
<p>The C++ standard [<a href="#references">3</a>] contains the definitions 
    of <code>zero-initialization</code> and <code>default-initialization</code>.
     Informally, zero-initialization means that the object is given the initial
     value 0 (converted to the type) and default-initialization means that
 POD   [<a href="#references">4</a>] types are zero-initialized, while non-POD class
 types   are initialized with their corresponding default constructors. A
<i>declaration</i>   can contain an <i>initializer</i>, which specifies the
object's initial value.  The initializer can be just '()', which states that
the object shall be value-initialized  (but see below). However, if a <i>declaration</i> 
  has no <i>initializer</i>  and it is of a non-<code>const</code>, non-<code>static</code> 
   POD type, the initial value is indeterminate: <cite>(see &sect;8.5, [dcl.init], for the
   accurate definitions).</cite></p>
                   
<pre>int x ; // no initializer. x value is indeterminate.<br>std::string s ; // no initializer, s is default-constructed.<br><br>int y = int() ; <br>// y is initialized using copy-initialization<br>// but the temporary uses an empty set of parentheses as the initializer,<br>// so it is default-constructed.<br>// A default constructed POD type is zero-initialized,<br>// therefore, y == 0.<br><br>void foo ( std::string ) ;<br>foo ( std::string() ) ; <br>// the temporary string is default constructed <br>// as indicated by the initializer ()  </pre>
                    
<h3><a name="valueinit">value-initialization</a></h3>
                   
<p>The first <a
 href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_defects.html">Technical 
  Corrigendum for the C++ Standard</a> (TC1), whose draft   was released to
  the public in November 2001, introduced <a
 href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/cwg_defects.html#178">Core 
  Issue 178</a> (among   many other issues, of course).</p>
                   
<p> That issue introduced the new concept of <code>value-initialization</code>
     (it also fixed the wording for zero-initialization). Informally, value-initialization 
    is similar to default-initialization with the exception that in some cases
    non-static data members and base class sub-objects are also value-initialized. 
    The difference is that an object that is value-initialized won't have 
(or    at least is less likely to have) indeterminate values for data members 
 and   base class sub-objects; unlike the case of an object default constructed. 
    (see Core Issue 178 for a normative description).</p>
                   
<p>In order to specify value-initialization of an object we need to use the
     empty-set initializer: (). </p>
                   
<p>As before, a declaration with no intializer specifies default-initialization, 
    and a declaration with a non-empty initializer specifies copy (=xxx) or
  direct  (xxx) initialization. </p>
                   
<pre>template&lt;class T&gt; void eat(T);<br>int x ; // indeterminate initial value.<br>std::string s; // default-initialized.<br>eat ( int() ) ; // value-initialized<br>eat ( std::string() ) ; // value-initialized</pre>
                    
<h4><a name="valueinitsyn">value-initialization</a> syntax</h4>
                   
<p>Value initialization is specified using (). However, the empty set of
parentheses is not permitted by the syntax of initializers because it is
parsed as the declaration of a function taking no arguments: </p>
                   
<pre>int x() ; // declares function int(*)()</pre>
                    
<p>Thus, the empty () must be put in some other initialization context.</p>
                   
<p>One alternative is to use copy-initialization syntax:</p>
                   
<pre>int x = int() ;</pre>
                    
<p>This works perfectly fine for POD types. But for non-POD class types,
copy-initialization searches for a suitable constructor, which could be,
for instance, the copy-constructor (it also searches for a suitable conversion
sequence but this doesn't apply in this context). For an arbitrary unknown
type, using this syntax may not have the value-initialization effect intended
because we don't know if a copy from a default constructed object is exactly
the same as a default constructed object, and the compiler is allowed (in
some cases), but never required to, optimize the copy away.</p>
                   
<p>One possible generic solution is to use value-initialization of a non static
data member:</p>
                   
<pre>template&lt;class T&gt; <br>struct W <br>{<br>  // value-initialization of 'data' here.<br>  W() : data() {}<br>  T data ;<br>} ;<br>W&lt;int&gt; w ;<br>// w.data is value-initialized for any type. </pre>
                    
<p>This is the solution as it was supplied by earlier versions of the
<code>value_initialized&lt;T&gt;</code> template
     class. Unfortunately this approach suffered from various compiler issues.</p>
		 
<h4><a name="compiler_issues">compiler issues</a> </h4>

Various compilers haven't yet fully implemented value-initialization.
So when an object should be <em>value-initialized</em> (according to the C++ Standard),
it <em>may</em> in practice still be left uninitialized, because of those
compiler issues! It's hard to make a general statement on what those issues
are like, because they depend on the compiler you are using, its version number,
and the type of object you would like to have value-initialized.
Compilers usually support value-initialization for built-in types properly.
But objects of user-defined types that involve <em>aggregates</em> may <em>in some cases</em>
be partially, or even entirely left uninitialized, when they should be value-initialized.

We have encountered issues regarding value-initialization on compilers by
Microsoft, Sun, Borland, and GNU. Here is a list of bug reports on those issues:

New versions of <code>value_initialized</code>
(Boost release version 1.35 or higher)
offer a workaround to these issues: <code>value_initialized</code> will now clear
its internal data, prior to constructing the object that it contains.

<h2><a name="types"></a>Types and objects</h2>
                   
<h2><a name="val_init"><code>template class value_initialized&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h2>
                   
<pre>namespace boost {<br><br>template&lt;class T&gt;<br>class value_initialized<br>{<br>  public :<br>    value_initialized() : x() {}<br>    operator T&amp;() const { return x ; }<br>    T&amp; data() const { return x ; }<br>    void swap( value_initialized&lt;T&gt;&amp; );<br><br>  private :<br>    <i>unspecified</i> x ;<br>} ;<br><br>template&lt;class T&gt;<br>T const&amp; get ( value_initialized&lt;T&gt; const&amp; x )<br>{<br>  return x.data() ;<br>}<br><br>template&lt;class T&gt;<br>T&amp; get ( value_initialized&lt;T&gt;&amp; x )<br>{<br>  return x.data() ;<br>}<br><br>} // namespace boost<br></pre>
                    
<p>An object of this template class is a <code>T</code>-wrapper convertible 
    to <code>'T&amp;'</code> whose wrapped object (data member of type <code>T</code>) 
    is <a href="#valueinit">value-initialized</a> upon default-initialization 
    of this wrapper class: </p>
                   
<pre>int zero = 0 ;<br>value_initialized&lt;int&gt; x ;<br>assert ( x == zero ) ;<br><br>std::string def ;<br>value_initialized&lt; std::string &gt; y ;<br>assert ( y == def ) ;<br></pre>
                    
<p>The purpose of this wrapper is to provide a consistent syntax for value
     initialization of scalar, union and class types (POD and non-POD) since
   the  correct syntax for value initialization varies (see <a
 href="#valueinitsyn">value-initialization syntax</a>)</p>
                   
<p>The wrapped object can be accessed either through the conversion operator
     <code>T&amp;</code>, the member function <code>data()</code>, or the
non-member    function <code>get()</code>:  </p>
                   
<pre>void watch(int);<br>value_initialized&lt;int&gt; x;<br><br>watch(x) ; // operator T&amp; used.<br>watch(x.data());<br>watch( get(x) ) // function get() used</pre>
                    
<p>Both <code>const</code> and non-<code>const</code> objects can be wrapped. 
    Mutable objects can be modified directly from within the wrapper but constant
    objects cannot:</p>

<p>When <code>T</code> is a <em>Swappable</em> type, <code>value_initialized&lt;T&gt;</code>
    is swappable as well, by calling its <code>swap</code> member function
    as well as by calling <code>boost::swap</code>.</p>
                   
<pre>value_initialized&lt;int&gt; x ; <br>static_cast&lt;int&amp;&gt;(x) = 1 ; // OK<br>get(x) = 1 ; // OK<br><br>value_initialized&lt;int const&gt; y ; <br>static_cast&lt;int&amp;&gt;(y) = 1 ; // ERROR: cannot cast to int&amp;<br>static_cast&lt;int const&amp;&gt;(y) = 1 ; // ERROR: cannot modify a const value<br>get(y) = 1 ; // ERROR: cannot modify a const value</pre>
                    
<h3>Warning:</h3>
                   
<p>Both the conversion operator and the <code>data()</code> member function 
    are <code>const</code> in order to allow access to the wrapped object 
from    a constant wrapper:</p>
                   
<pre>void foo(int);<br>value_initialized&lt;int&gt; const x ;<br>foo(x);<br></pre>
                    
<p>But notice that this conversion operator is to <code>T&amp;</code> although 
    it is itself <code>const</code>. As a consequence, if <code>T</code> is
  a  non-<code>const</code> type, you can modify the wrapped object even from
   within a constant wrapper:</p>
                   
<pre>value_initialized&lt;int&gt; const x_c ;<br>int&amp; xr = x_c ; // OK, conversion to int&amp; available even though x_c is itself const.<br>xr = 2 ; </pre>
                    
<p>The reason for this obscure behavior is that some commonly used compilers
     just don't accept the following valid code:</p>
                   
<pre>struct X<br>{<br>  operator int&amp;() ;<br>  operator int const&amp;() const ;   <br>};<br>X x ;<br>(x == 1 ) ; // ERROR HERE!</pre>
                    
<p>These compilers complain about ambiguity between the conversion operators. 
    This complaint is incorrect, but the only workaround that I know of is 
 to   provide only one of them, which leads to the obscure behavior just explained.<br>
          </p>
                   
<h3>Recommended practice: The non-member get() idiom</h3>
                   
<p>The obscure behavior of being able to modify a non-<code>const</code>
wrapped object from within a constant wrapper can be avoided if access to
the wrapped object is always performed with the <code>get()</code> idiom:</p>
                   
<pre>value_initialized&lt;int&gt; x ;<br>get(x) = 1 ; // OK<br><br>value_initialized&lt;int const&gt; cx ;<br>get(x) = 1 ; // ERROR: Cannot modify a const object<br><br>value_initialized&lt;int&gt; const x_c ;<br>get(x_c) = 1 ; // ERROR: Cannot modify a const object<br><br>value_initialized&lt;int const&gt; const cx_c ;<br>get(cx_c) = 1 ; // ERROR: Cannot modify a const object<br></pre>

<h2><a name="initialized_value"><code>initialized_value</code></a></h2>

<pre>
namespace boost {
class initialized_value_t
{
  public :
    template &lt;class T&gt; operator T() const ;
};

initialized_value_t const initialized_value = {} ;

} // namespace boost
</pre>

<code>initialized_value</code> provides a convenient way to get
an initialized value: its conversion operator provides an appropriate
<em>value-initialized</em> object for any CopyConstructible type.

Suppose you need to have an initialized variable of type <code>T</code>.
You could do it as follows:
<pre>
  T var = T();
</pre>
But as mentioned before, this form suffers from various compiler issues.
The template <code>value_initialized</code> offers a workaround:
<pre>
  T var = get( value_initialized&lt;T&gt;() );
</pre>
Unfortunately both forms repeat the type name, which
is rather short now (<code>T</code>), but could of course be 
more like <code>Namespace::Template&lt;Arg&gt;::Type</code>.
Instead, one could use <code>initialized_value</code> as follows:
<pre>
  T var = initialized_value ;
</pre>
                    
<h3><a name="references">References</a></h3>
          [1] Bjarne Stroustrup, Gabriel Dos Reis, and J. Stephen Adamczyk wrote
          various papers, proposing to extend the support for brace-enclosed <em>initializer lists</em>
          in the next version of C++.
          This would allow a variable <code>var</code> of any DefaultConstructible type
          <code>T</code> to be <em>value-initialized</em> by doing <code>T var = {}</code>.

-> add private_read_only to mapped_region to support MAP_PRIVATE plus PROT_READ

-> add contiguous_elements option to burst allocation

-> Test construct<> with throwing constructors

-> Implement zero_memory flag for allocation_command

-> The general allocation funtion can be improved with some fixed size allocation bins.

-> Adapt error reporting to TR1 system exceptions

-> Improve exception messages

-> Movability of containers should depend on the no-throw guarantee of allocators copy constructor

-> Check self-assignment for vectors

-> Update writing a new memory allocator explaining new functions (like alignment)

-> private node allocators could take the number of nodes as a runtime parameter.

-> Explain how to build intrusive indexes.

-> Add intrusive index types as available indexes.

-> Add maximum alignment allocation limit in PageSize bytes. Otherwise, we can't
   guarantee alignment for process-shared allocations.

-> Add default algorithm and index types. The user does not need to know how are
   they implemented.

-> Pass max size check in allocation to node pools

-> Use in-place expansion capabilities to shrink_to_fit and reserve functions
   from iunordered_index.

-> change unique_ptr to avoid using compressed_pair

-> Improve unique_ptr test to test move assignment and other goodies like assigment from null

-> barrier_test fails on MacOS X on PowerPC.

-> use virtual functions to minimize template explosion in managed classes

-> Insertions with InpIt are not tested in containers

-> Run tests with rvalue reference compilers with no variadic insertions

-> find a way to pass security attributes to shared memory

-> Explain in docs that shared memory can't be used between different users in windows

-> Implement vector with memcpy/memmove for trivially copyable types.

-> flat_xxx constructors are not documented

-> operator >> eta antzekoek moved_value behar dute 

-> Add cmath workaround for Boost < 1.37

-> rvalue reference enabled compilers are not optimized with is_movable and move_iterator

-> Add allocator test template that test all new functions (allocate_many, etc.)

-> MacOS shm_open is non-conformant. Is there a way to know the size of a shared memory object?

have a look at `read_key_framed_mesh_object()` in `meshobjectreader.cpp`
this function uses `read_mesh_object()` to read a single "pose" (i.e. a single key frame)
after loading each pose, it set the new vertex positions in the mesh using `set_vertex_poses()`
you should also have a look at the `renderer::MeshObject` API
in `meshobject.h`
it should be decently self-explanatory

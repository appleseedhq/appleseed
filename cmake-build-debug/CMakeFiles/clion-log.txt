CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:40 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0026 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

CMake Error at /home/syrix/Downloads/CLion-2017.3.4/clion-2017.3.4/bin/cmake/share/cmake-3.9/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:1900 (message):
  Unable to find the requested Boost libraries.

  Boost version: 1.61.0

  Boost include path:
  /home/syrix/programs/appleseedtask/prebuilt-linux-deps-master/include/boost_1_61_0


  Could not find the following static Boost libraries:

          boost_atomic
          boost_chrono
          boost_date_time
          boost_filesystem
          boost_regex
          boost_system
          boost_thread
          boost_wave

  Some (but not all) of the required Boost libraries were found.  You may
  need to install these additional Boost libraries.  Alternatively, set
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to the directory containing Boost libraries or BOOST_ROOT
  to the location of Boost.
